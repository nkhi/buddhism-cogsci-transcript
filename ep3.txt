(00:00) [Music]
(00:04) you
(00:04) [Music]
(00:14) welcome back to awakening from the
(00:16) meeting crisis this is our third time
(00:20) together last time we were talking about
(00:24) more what was going on in shamanism and
(00:27) the Upper Paleolithic transition we
(00:30) talked a lot about the flow experience
(00:32) and how it integrates altered states of
(00:35) consciousness something like or at least
(00:38) on a continuum with mystical experiences
(00:40) and meaning making enhanced insight and
(00:44) intuition and how this resulted in an
(00:47) enhanced capacity for metaphorical
(00:49) cognition which greatly expands human
(00:53) cognition makes it much more creative
(00:55) much more capable of generating all of
(00:59) those fantastic connections in meaning
(01:03) that drove the upper paleolithic
(01:06) transitions explosion in culture and
(01:08) technology and then we moved to consider
(01:13) some other intervening revolutions that
(01:16) also had an impact we talked briefly
(01:19) about the Neolithic Revolution and the
(01:22) beginning of Agriculture and then the
(01:24) rise of civilizations we got into the
(01:27) Bronze Age civilization and then that
(01:28) led us into the revolution we're
(01:31) concentrating on now which is the axial
(01:33) revolution a period around between 800
(01:36) BCE and 300 BCE following the Bronze Age
(01:39) collapse the Bronze Age collapse if you
(01:42) remember was one of the greatest if not
(01:44) the greatest collapse in civilization
(01:46) the world has ever seen and that
(01:48) facilitated much more experimentation in
(01:52) smaller scale societies and that
(01:56) experimentation resulted in the creation
(01:59) of new psycho technologies one was
(02:02) alphabetic literacy happening in the
(02:05) area of canaan and it's eventually going
(02:06) to be taken up very quickly by the
(02:09) Hebrews and then taken up by the
(02:11) Phoenicians and taken to the Greeks the
(02:13) Greeks as we'll see today or at least
(02:15) today or next time further improved it
(02:19) we talked about how that psycho
(02:23) technology alphabetic literacy makes
(02:26) literacy
(02:27) more effective more efficiently learned
(02:30) more powerful its operation greatly
(02:32) expands the number of people that can be
(02:34) literate enhances the distributed
(02:36) cognition and how that psycho technology
(02:39) gets internalized into our meta
(02:41) cognition and produces second-order
(02:43) thought we get an enhanced awareness of
(02:45) our own cognition both its power and its
(02:47) peril we get an enhanced awareness of
(02:50) its capacity for self correction and
(02:51) self transcendence we also get an
(02:53) enhanced awareness of its capacity for
(02:55) self-deception
(02:56) we talked also about the invention of
(02:58) coinage to help deal with the mobile
(03:00) armies of this time and how that trains
(03:05) you in abstract symbolic thought and
(03:08) more rigorous mathematical reasoning and
(03:12) that also gets internalized it gets
(03:15) exacted right into second order thinking
(03:18) and people start to become aware of
(03:20) themselves in a different way they start
(03:22) to become much more aware of the
(03:24) meaning-making nature of their of the
(03:26) cognition its capacity to generate
(03:28) illusion and self-deception and also its
(03:31) capacity to break out of illusion and
(03:34) self-deception and to come into a
(03:37) contact with a more real world so this
(03:42) leads to some fundamental changes people
(03:44) start to become more aware of their
(03:48) responsibility for the violence and the
(03:51) chaos and the suffering in their own
(03:53) lives and they start to become aware of
(03:55) how much the transformation of mind or
(03:58) mind and heart because in the actual age
(04:01) these terms are often referred to in a
(04:04) singular manner how much transformation
(04:07) in the mind and heart is the way to
(04:09) alleviate suffering so what starts to
(04:13) happen is the mythological framing frame
(04:16) framework and the way people are framing
(04:18) themselves and their world changes now
(04:20) let me explain to you how I'm using this
(04:22) word myth because I'm not using it the
(04:25) way we standardly use it this you did
(04:28) the use I'm going to talk about it's
(04:29) been deeply influenced by people like
(04:31) young people like Tillich Victor Turner
(04:34) just a whole bunch of different fingers
(04:36) so when we use the word myth
(04:38) to mean a falsehood that is widely
(04:40) believed okay and that's unfortunate
(04:45) because we've lost the term for what I
(04:48) want to talk about see miss aren't fault
(04:53) stories about the ancient past
(04:56) there's symbolic stories about perennial
(04:59) patterns that are always with us that's
(05:02) a very different thing so a lot of
(05:07) what's going on in myth is an attempt to
(05:09) take these intuitive implicitly learned
(05:12) patterns and put them into some form
(05:14) that is shareable with ourselves and
(05:17) with each other so in the Bronze Age
(05:23) world before the axial revolution people
(05:27) experience the world in what's been
(05:30) called by Charles Taylor like the
(05:34) continuous cosmos well I have a few
(05:39) questions about the use of the word
(05:40) cosmos but we'll come back to that later
(05:50) the idea here is human being has
(05:52) experienced themselves in radical
(05:54) continuity that that sense of
(05:56) connectedness right that you see even
(06:00) back in the shamanic world was very
(06:03) prevalent in the continuous cosmos and
(06:04) the continuous cosmos people feel
(06:06) there's a deep connection a deep
(06:08) continuity between the natural world and
(06:09) the cultural world and between the
(06:12) cultural world and the world of the gods
(06:15) so the difference is right are not
(06:20) really differences so much in kind as
(06:22) they are in power it's not odd that
(06:25) animals might talk alright or they might
(06:29) have sort of deep societies it's not odd
(06:32) for us for certain human individuals to
(06:36) think themselves divine like the
(06:39) greatest actual age sorry the great the
(06:42) greatest pre Axial Age Empire is Egypt
(06:45) and the Pharaoh is a God king he's
(06:49) something like a God why for up for us
(06:52) we can only understand that at most
(06:54) metaphorically here's what you have to
(06:55) try and understand it's not a metaphor
(06:57) for the ancient Egyptians why because
(07:02) the difference is between right human
(07:07) beings and the gods our differences in
(07:09) power this is a cosmos that is
(07:12) experience where reality is experienced
(07:14) primarily in power in terms of power the
(07:18) gods are just more powerful than us more
(07:22) glorious than us
(07:23) you can even see this in the Old
(07:25) Testament right where if you got if you
(07:29) ask people you can ask people what you
(07:31) know what term is most often used of God
(07:34) and people will say you know righteous
(07:35) or holy well those are used quite often
(07:40) but the term that's most used is
(07:41) glorious shining with power right which
(07:46) it's not a moral term at all think of
(07:49) the Greek gods they're not moral
(07:51) exemplars at all they're just extremely
(07:53) glorious and extremely powerful the
(07:56) Egyptian King the Pharaoh is extremely
(07:59) glorious and extremely powerful
(08:02) so of course he's godlike or potentially
(08:05) even a god so there's a continuous
(08:09) cosmos and it's continuous in another
(08:13) way right it moves like this it moves in
(08:18) great cycles just like the seasons just
(08:24) like day and night time moves in large
(08:27) cycles that repeat through eternity in
(08:33) fact what you're often trying to do with
(08:37) your ritual behavior is you're trying to
(08:40) tap into this continuity you're trying
(08:43) to get back to the original power of
(08:46) creation so you often enact the
(08:53) metaphorical story the myth of how the
(08:56) universe is created in order to try and
(08:58) tap into that creative power there's a
(09:02) there's a there's a constant nostalgia
(09:04) for getting back right and your attitude
(09:09) towards the world is you want to fit in
(09:11) to these cycles you want to be in
(09:12) harmony with them you don't want to
(09:14) really change things a lot because if I
(09:16) change this if I change my future I'm
(09:19) actually undermining my past it's a very
(09:23) different way of relating to the world
(09:24) so it's there's this continuity between
(09:27) the natural world the social world and
(09:31) the divine world and time is wrapped on
(09:35) itself in this really important way now
(09:43) what happens in the axial age is this
(09:44) way of looking at things
(09:46) is shattered now it doesn't go away
(09:48) there's aspects of our thinking that are
(09:50) still like this but what gets layered on
(09:54) top of it is a totally different
(09:56) worldview a totally different mythology
(09:58) for understanding the relationship
(10:00) between the self and the world so
(10:04) Charles Taylor's talks about this as the
(10:06) great dis embedding when the axial
(10:09) revolution hits this world is replaced
(10:13) by a different one
(10:16) now again I'm speaking mythologically
(10:20) here people will talk about it
(10:21) mythologically and you have to
(10:22) understand that doesn't mean the way we
(10:25) would think of it as a literal
(10:26) scientific thing nor is it what we would
(10:28) merely call metaphorical mythological is
(10:31) neither scientific nor just metaphorical
(10:36) now what's this new world well this new
(10:42) mythological worldview uses a mythology
(10:45) of two worlds the idea is this is the
(10:52) everyday world this is the world of the
(11:00) untrained mind this is a world that is
(11:02) beset by self-deception self-destruction
(11:05) the illusion violence chaos it's a world
(11:09) in which we are out of touch with
(11:11) reality but opposed to this is the real
(11:19) world and mythologically you can talk
(11:22) about this as two worlds but of course
(11:23) in a lot of the traditions the real
(11:25) world is just cutting through the
(11:27) illusion of the everyday world but the
(11:30) idea is the real world is how the
(11:32) trained mind the wise mind sees the
(11:36) world this is how the world looks when
(11:38) you're in touch with reality when your
(11:40) mind is not beset by illusion and
(11:42) delusion when you have that sense that
(11:44) this is how things really are this is a
(11:48) world also in which there is reduced
(11:50) suffering and violence precisely because
(11:52) the mind is not beset by foolishness
(11:54) precisely because it is not out of touch
(11:57) with reality
(12:01) now here wisdom is power oriented to be
(12:08) a wise individual is to learn how to
(12:11) acquire the power that was imbued at
(12:15) creation into the cycles it's like
(12:18) energies put into the system and it
(12:20) cycles around and then energy is put in
(12:22) the system it cycles around and you want
(12:23) to tap into that power wisdom is how to
(12:26) tap in to that power
(12:28) because what you're after is like long
(12:33) life live long and prosper
(12:37) as it's in the Star Trek when with ology
(12:39) for the Vulcans right you you want to be
(12:40) prosperous you want to live long you
(12:42) want to be free of conflict right you
(12:45) want to provide security for your
(12:47) offspring so that's a sense of wisdom
(12:51) that is still captured in our sense of
(12:53) the word prudence right being very
(12:57) Prudential is to have that sort of
(12:59) knowing how to fit in to the power
(13:01) structures of society how to make things
(13:04) work for you getting the most power and
(13:07) prosperity you can but over here there's
(13:12) a radical change wisdom changes because
(13:17) look you do not want to fit into this
(13:19) world because this is the world of
(13:24) suffering and violence it's a world in
(13:28) which you're out of touch with what's
(13:30) real and as we'll talk about it later
(13:33) you deeply desire to be in touch with
(13:35) reality it's one of your most powerful
(13:36) drives you don't want to conform to this
(13:41) world you want to be transformed out of
(13:43) this world you want to move from here to
(13:48) here now notice what's happening here
(13:51) the old shamanic enacted myth of soul
(13:54) flight flying above is being accepted
(13:58) into a new sense it's being exempted
(14:00) into this sense of self transcendence
(14:02) out of the everyday world into the real
(14:07) world and wisdom is now knowing how to
(14:12) make that transformative leap and
(14:17) meaning isn't about just connectedness
(14:22) as it was here but a special kind of
(14:24) connectedness a connectedness to the
(14:28) real world as opposed to a detrimental
(14:32) connectedness to an illusory world so
(14:36) meaning is changing and the notion of
(14:39) wisdom is changing
(14:40) and the notion of yourself what it is to
(14:44) be a self because here you're defined
(14:47) largely by how you fit in and of course
(14:50) that's always gonna be part of our
(14:51) definition I'm talking about emphasis
(14:53) here I'm not talking about absolute
(14:54) differences but here you're defined more
(14:57) by how you fit in but here you defined
(15:01) increasingly more by how you can self
(15:05) transcend self transform how you can
(15:09) grow as a person
(15:11) notice how pervasive this has become in
(15:14) our self understand notice how we don't
(15:17) like to be with people who aren't
(15:20) growing who aren't somehow transcending
(15:24) growing which way do you growing up
(15:27) right becoming more mature getting more
(15:31) in touch with themselves and reality so
(15:39) this is called the great dis embedding
(15:41) because now we we have a different
(15:45) relationship to the everyday world and
(15:47) this is a metaphor that you don't see
(15:49) before you don't see over here this is
(15:52) the idea that we're somehow strangers in
(15:54) the world
(15:56) we're pilgrims we don't belong here we
(16:01) belong there
(16:02) now as I keep saying I mean some people
(16:05) some people of course will literal eyes
(16:07) this and this is really one world in
(16:09) another world
(16:10) most people will see this alike we talk
(16:12) about Plato and others their
(16:13) understanding this as a mythological
(16:15) representation for the process of self
(16:18) transcendence and self transformation so
(16:25) once again we see the exaptation just
(16:29) like the shamans were engaged in
(16:31) excitation we see the acceptation of
(16:34) that shamanic ability into this new
(16:40) mythological framework
(16:45) so there's three places that I want to
(16:48) talk about in particular about this
(16:50) because they're the ones that we're
(16:53) going to talk a lot about I will mention
(16:55) China periodically throughout especially
(16:58) when I talk about Taoism but I want to
(17:01) talk about Greece and ancient Israel
(17:04) because those are the two foundational
(17:06) world mythologies for us those are two
(17:09) places and when theocracy or revolution
(17:11) took place in a way that has become
(17:13) deeply deeply constitutive of what we
(17:17) are how we are still here in our minds
(17:21) the way we experience ourselves and the
(17:24) world I also want to talk about India
(17:26) because India is the source of that of
(17:32) that how do I put it that source of the
(17:38) confluence between Buddhism and the
(17:41) Western world that we talked about in
(17:43) the first session together
(17:45) the mindfulness revolution mindfulness
(17:48) is a psycho technology that came from
(17:50) India so the axial revolution of
(17:52) Siddhartha Gautama and the Buddha we're
(17:55) going to talk about that and what I want
(17:59) to talk about is how each one of these
(18:01) areas in addition to the axial psycho
(18:04) technologies of literacy and coinage
(18:06) alphabetic literacy and coinage write
(18:08) how they also develop particular psycho
(18:11) technologies that have become
(18:14) internalized a lot of what you think is
(18:17) natural to you just part of how your
(18:19) mind works is actually culturally
(18:21) internalized it has been generated
(18:24) historically and you have internalized
(18:25) it culturally and you think of it just
(18:29) as how your mind works think again about
(18:31) literacy it is hard for you to remember
(18:34) and I mean to reenact what it was like
(18:37) to not be able to think in write like
(18:41) literate terms to imagine words
(18:47) in a similar way a lot of these ways of
(18:51) thinking these psycho technologies have
(18:52) become so second nature to us that we
(18:55) forget the historical origin and that's
(18:57) problematic because the degree to which
(18:59) we don't have a historical understanding
(19:01) is a degree to which we are going to be
(19:05) ignorant of the historical factors that
(19:07) are driving the meaning crisis let me
(19:11) foreshadow that meeting crisis right now
(19:12) so this is a mere foreshadowing we're
(19:14) going to come back to it this is a
(19:20) mythological way of thinking which
(19:25) allows us to articulate and train the
(19:31) psycho technologies of the axial
(19:33) revolution these psycho technologies of
(19:35) self-transcendence of wisdom and
(19:39) enhanced meaning but the problem is this
(19:44) mythology is failing for us now the
(19:49) scientific worldview is destroying the
(19:52) possibility of this for us in a way that
(19:57) might seem sort of cosmically or ironic
(20:00) the scientific worldview is returning us
(20:03) to a continuous cosmos there is no
(20:05) radical difference in kind between you
(20:08) and the primates that you evolved from
(20:11) naturally there isn't some radical
(20:15) difference in kind between your mind and
(20:18) your embodied existence right science is
(20:21) leveling the world we're returning to a
(20:25) one world we're going to talk about that
(20:32) but if we can no longer live in this
(20:36) mythology and that's what mythologies
(20:38) are they're they have to be livable
(20:41) people claim to believe this don't tell
(20:44) me what you believe tell me what you can
(20:46) practice tell me what's livable for you
(20:49) for most of us we can't live this
(20:52) anymore
(20:52) we still talk this way but we can't live
(20:56) it so here's part of the problem this is
(20:58) a foreshadowing
(21:00) how do we salvage the ability to
(21:05) cultivate wisdom self transcendence
(21:08) enhance meaning overcome self-deception
(21:11) realize realize who we are and how the
(21:16) world is when we can no longer use the
(21:22) mythological worldview in which it was
(21:24) born we are going through a reimburse of
(21:32) and increasing right Copernicus and
(21:36) Galileo REM bettas Darwin reom beds us
(21:38) Einstein reinvent us were that we're
(21:41) being reinvented back into the physical
(21:43) world but we don't want to lose all that
(21:47) we gained through the great dis
(21:49) embedding how do we reconcile those how
(21:53) do we live with the legacy of the actual
(21:56) revolution when we can no longer inhabit
(21:59) its world of view that's part of the
(22:02) problem that's only part now the place I
(22:06) want to turn to first is ancient Israel
(22:11) as I mentioned some of you have probably
(22:14) read parts of the Bible or at least
(22:17) heard parts of the Bible although
(22:18) biblical illiteracy is rising and that's
(22:22) problematic not not because I think
(22:25) people should be Christians or Jews I'm
(22:27) not here to proselytize but the degree
(22:29) to which you don't have a grasp of the
(22:32) grammar of the Bible is it re to which
(22:34) you don't have a grasp of the grammar of
(22:36) your own cognition and you may say I'm
(22:38) an atheist I don't care that's
(22:40) irrelevant I'm not talking about what
(22:42) you say I'm talking about how you think
(22:46) there's a big difference there grammar
(22:48) is how you put thoughts together it's
(22:50) not the vocabulary it's not what you say
(22:53) and so this is what Nietzsche meant and
(22:56) like like when he said I fear we are not
(23:01) getting rid of God because we still
(23:02) believe in grammar we still talk this
(23:08) way we still are filled with the god
(23:11) grammar
(23:13) of the Bible and you say no I'm not yes
(23:17) you go to a movie and you watch the
(23:19) person who falls in some way and then
(23:22) they have an insight and they are
(23:24) redeemed and they find their way back
(23:26) maybe it's through Alcoholics Anonymous
(23:27) or they come out of addiction that's
(23:30) biblical grammar okay
(23:35) again what matters here is how it shapes
(23:39) our sense of self and world I'm not
(23:42) advocating for a particular religion but
(23:44) of course I'm going to talk about the
(23:45) judeo-christian heritage precisely
(23:47) because I want to explain to you how
(23:50) these psycho technologies have been part
(23:53) of the very grammar not only of your
(23:55) cognition but of your existential sense
(23:57) of being so there's an important psycho
(24:07) technology that's invented or at least
(24:10) significantly developed by ancient
(24:12) Israel perhaps it was influenced from
(24:15) from Persia through Zarathustra but it's
(24:20) this idea and when I say it it's gonna
(24:22) seem to you like of course but it's not
(24:24) of course even saying of course is
(24:27) important remember that here's the idea
(24:31) it's a psycho technology of
(24:33) understanding time as a cosmic narrative
(24:37) as a story it's applying something again
(24:41) that's universal all cultures tell
(24:43) stories and we'll talk about the
(24:45) cognitive science of this later but you
(24:49) see this isn't a story this is a circle
(24:52) it's a cycle
(24:54) what kind of structure does a story how
(24:56) well the story has a beginning and has
(25:00) some crucial climax turning point and
(25:04) that and there's a resolution there's a
(25:07) direction to it there's a purpose to it
(25:13) so you get this idea of cosmic history
(25:16) of using our skills for story to explain
(25:22) how the cosmos is unfolding through time
(25:26) it's a radical idea so why is it radical
(25:33) well notice the difference here this
(25:36) this is not an open future right you're
(25:41) condemned to repeat that so cultures
(25:44) we're cyclical time is still prevalent
(25:46) Eastern cultures for example the
(25:48) repetition of the cycle is onerous it's
(25:51) horrible
(25:52) people think reincarnation for example
(25:54) within an Indian context is a wonderful
(25:56) I'll be born again that's good no that's
(25:58) horrible what you're trying to do is get
(26:00) free from those cycles because doing
(26:03) this again and again and again and again
(26:05) and again is terrifying
(26:10) moksha you want freedom nirvana you want
(26:13) cessation you want release from the
(26:15) cycle because there is no purpose to it
(26:23) but here the futures opened your actions
(26:30) now can change the future if you figure
(26:35) out how to participate
(26:36) remember that participatory knowing if
(26:39) you figure out how to participate in the
(26:41) story your actions can change the future
(26:47) there isn't the all at once creation at
(26:50) the beginning there's an ongoing
(26:52) creation through history and you can
(26:55) participate with God in the ongoing
(26:58) creation of the future how because how
(27:04) do stories operate they operate in terms
(27:06) of meaning and morality how you make
(27:09) meaning the moral content of your action
(27:12) decides how things are going to go see
(27:18) this is why the god of ancient Israel is
(27:20) such a different God if you look at the
(27:24) gods of the pre axial world look you've
(27:27) got a god and it's a god of a place a
(27:29) particular function here's the god of
(27:32) weaving or here's the god of ancient
(27:34) Thebes right the gods are located in
(27:36) place they're tied to a function they
(27:39) have no significant moral arc attached
(27:42) to them what's the God of the Old
(27:44) Testament what he or she like it's not
(27:51) bound to time in place
(27:53) think of the great story of the Old
(27:55) Testament the story of the Exodus what
(27:59) right here you have the Israelites and
(28:03) they are imprisoned they're imprisoned
(28:06) in the epitome of the Bronze Age world
(28:09) Egypt and God comes and liberates them
(28:14) and sets them on a journey towards a
(28:19) future that is promised the promised
(28:22) land this God moves through time and
(28:25) space
(28:26) the God of the Old Testament is the God
(28:28) of the open future that's why at first
(28:31) he has no name because to name something
(28:35) is to locate it to specify it to tie it
(28:38) down and for the longest time this God
(28:42) has no name and then when Moses finally
(28:46) challenges it and he reveals his name he
(28:49) says it's badly translated in the older
(28:51) versions of the Bible it's often
(28:53) translated as I am that I am but it acts
(28:56) in the Hebrew means I will be what I
(28:58) will be I am the God of the open future
(29:00) and you can participate with me in this
(29:06) this ongoing creation of the future
(29:10) because you can shape it you can cause
(29:13) it to come to resolution but you can
(29:16) also cause it to go off course the idea
(29:22) when I said of course to you remember
(29:24) the sense of time passing as a course we
(29:28) still take courses in universities this
(29:32) is what we have here and you're looking
(29:36) for turning points where the course
(29:40) turns and of course that's what you're
(29:42) looking for in a movie you know at some
(29:45) level that none of that is how the real
(29:47) world works you know at Psalm level come
(29:52) you do that your life doesn't unfold
(29:55) like a movie yet you love it
(29:58) you love going to a movie you love
(30:01) seeing this structure and participating
(30:04) in it and there's the great turning
(30:05) point where something is learned or a
(30:10) problem is solved and there's resolution
(30:13) and the future is now made so this God
(30:25) is interested in becomes progressively
(30:29) not now again you can't point and say
(30:32) there there's where it changed in the
(30:34) Bible but you can see there's aspects of
(30:36) a pre Axio god but as you read through
(30:40) the new as you read through the Old
(30:42) Testament God becomes more and more
(30:44) axial it becomes more and more the deity
(30:51) of something that you now take for
(30:53) granted progress
(31:02) the idea and right for us it's not just
(31:06) an idea right it's it's it's it's in the
(31:08) lifeblood it's in the very bones of your
(31:12) sense of self in your life is your life
(31:14) progressing or are you stuck
(31:17) is it moving forward this is this idea
(31:22) history progresses and it can degenerate
(31:25) and it can improve God becomes more and
(31:29) more a representative of that now
(31:35) there's a technical term for these
(31:37) turning points
(31:39) Kairos it's developed by the theologian
(31:44) Paul Tillich this is this sense of the
(31:46) crucial turning point getting things at
(31:49) the right time and the right place to
(31:51) turn things either right back on course
(31:55) or to further develop them now let's
(31:59) talk about that because again we're
(32:00) going to go back to talking about these
(32:02) set these senses of knowing that we've
(32:05) lost touch with important is this sense
(32:10) to off
(32:16) so people sometimes note and often
(32:19) humorously that the Bible will talk
(32:23) about sex sexual intercourse with the
(32:25) verb knowing so you'll get things like
(32:28) Adam knew his wife Eve and he's like
(32:30) what what does that mean
(32:31) and it means has sex with it's off in
(32:34) this sense and it's like what why what
(32:37) we don't use sex as a metaphor for
(32:39) knowledge you'd be surprised how many
(32:43) cultures actually do because this is
(32:46) again this is a participatory sense
(32:50) there's a course here and you're
(32:52) participating in it now what do I mean
(32:54) by participating you don't know it from
(32:56) the outside just having beliefs about it
(32:58) or just having skills you know it in
(33:00) this way you know it by identifying with
(33:03) it you change it while it's changing you
(33:06) and you're changing it while it's
(33:08) changing you you are immersed in it like
(33:09) a stream like a course of a river you
(33:12) are participating in it when you're
(33:16) making love with somebody you are
(33:18) participating in them you are
(33:21) identifying with them empathizing with
(33:23) them resonating with them you are
(33:26) changing them as they are changing you
(33:28) and it rises forgive me the pun to a
(33:31) climax to a turning point to a
(33:34) resolution see in ancient Israel faith
(33:42) this term has become useless for us now
(33:45) but faith didn't mean believing
(33:48) ridiculous things for which there is no
(33:49) evidence that is that is not that is a
(33:53) recent idea that is not what it meant
(33:56) faith was your sense of de ha faith was
(33:59) your sense that you're in this
(34:01) reciprocal realization you're in course
(34:05) you're on course you're involved and
(34:09) evolving with things it's your sense ah
(34:14) I'm on course or even your sense ah this
(34:18) is the turning point and I know what to
(34:20) do I know who I need to change into I
(34:25) knew how to turn myself and things
(34:30) notice you have this in your
(34:32) relationships you'll often be asking
(34:36) yourself how is this relationship going
(34:38) is it on course is it progressing is it
(34:44) growing is this the kind of person I
(34:46) want to be
(34:47) what's my am i becoming what's my sense
(34:49) of how I'm changing is this all going
(34:53) well that's the off now of course you
(35:03) can get it wrong you can think you're on
(35:07) course when you're actually dramatically
(35:10) off course you're trespassing to use
(35:14) older biblical language you're walking
(35:17) off the path you're no longer on course
(35:21) that's that's the basis of a word that
(35:24) we can't use anymore again because of
(35:26) our biblical literacy and the fact that
(35:28) we've lost touch with this sense of
(35:30) knowing in fact this word many people
(35:32) treat this word almost like like a
(35:34) comical word sin sinning isn't just
(35:41) doing something very immoral right in
(35:46) the New Testament the word that
(35:47) translates this is when you're shooting
(35:49) a bow and arrow
(35:50) so if you've done archery you can't
(35:53) shoot for where your eye tells you to
(35:54) look because you'll actually miss the
(35:55) bull's eye you have to have a kind of
(35:58) faith to sense right where you need to
(36:01) actually shoot so you don't miss the
(36:03) mark so the idea here is I'm trying to
(36:08) sense the course of things and if I'm
(36:11) self deluded or illusory I'm actually
(36:13) dramatically off course without
(36:15) realizing it that's the original meaning
(36:21) and so the idea is that human beings are
(36:25) thrown into this universe in which they
(36:28) have the option because it's an open
(36:32) future of participating in the creation
(36:35) of the future but of course human beings
(36:38) sin
(36:41) in the sense that they are
(36:43) self-deceptive they go off course so
(36:48) notice what the Hebrews are doing
(36:49) they're taking this movement from the
(36:52) everyday world to the real world and
(36:54) they're turning it into a historical
(36:56) story the way you go from the false
(36:59) world to the real world is you start now
(37:01) and you move towards the promised land
(37:05) they understand it historically but
(37:11) human being sinned they make decisions
(37:14) that steer the course of history away
(37:20) from its culmination and so the idea is
(37:26) God has to intervene periodically God
(37:30) has to redeem God has to do something to
(37:35) wake people up to remind them to help
(37:39) them to sense how they've gone of course
(37:41) and so that they can come back on course
(37:44) and so what you have is you have in the
(37:49) Old Testament you have the creation of
(37:51) the prophetic tradition prophets here's
(37:54) another thing that we've lost the sense
(37:56) of a prophet is not somebody who for who
(37:59) tells the future like some sort of
(38:01) psychic okay prophecy isn't about
(38:04) telling you what's going to be happening
(38:07) 200 or 300 years from now prophecy means
(38:13) a telling fourth yeah the job of the
(38:17) Prophet is to wake you up right now to
(38:21) how you are off course so a better
(38:25) analogy isn't the psychic when you so
(38:28) when you go to the psychic and oh you
(38:29) Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger or some
(38:31) crap like that that's not a good analogy
(38:34) for a prophet a better profit is when
(38:36) you and your loved one go into therapy
(38:38) and the therapist says something and it
(38:43) wakes you up the Holy crop this is how
(38:46) I'm going wrong this is how I'm
(38:47) off-course this is how I need to get
(38:50) back on track
(38:54) that's the job of a prophet and what you
(38:58) have in the prophetic tradition is you
(39:00) have an increasing emphasis on the
(39:09) morality of human decision-making more
(39:13) and more and again it's not perfect
(39:15) there's all kinds of pre axial stuff
(39:18) that's still woven in there and mixed up
(39:19) with it and mashed up with it but you do
(39:21) have more and more this discussion this
(39:25) exhortation to wake up to your moral
(39:28) responsibility for helping everybody to
(39:32) get back on track and to turn things
(39:35) back towards the promised land this idea
(39:38) of justice and righteousness and waking
(39:44) up so that we get back on track become
(39:48) endemic now think about how much and
(39:51) I've tried to show you three examples
(39:53) how much this is just how you naturally
(39:55) think of yourself you think of yourself
(39:59) as somebody who's on a journey you're
(40:01) starting here and you're trying to make
(40:03) a better self and you're trying to make
(40:05) the right decisions and you're trying to
(40:07) steer things you want your life to
(40:12) progress you want your culture to
(40:14) progress try to think about what how you
(40:20) would understand yourself how you would
(40:23) judge yourself and you couldn't make use
(40:28) of this notion of progress
(40:34) so what starts to happen is a commitment
(40:44) to more and more trying to cultivate the
(40:49) wisdom of deeply remembering God which
(40:53) doesn't mean reciting beliefs it means
(40:57) participating participating in the
(41:03) ongoing creation of the world shaping
(41:07) the future helping yourself your
(41:10) neighbors in your society to progress
(41:13) where that progress is measured mostly
(41:17) in terms of moral improvement increasing
(41:20) justice increasing flourishing
(41:23) increasing sense of people living up to
(41:26) their promise and this is what I ask you
(41:29) do you feel like you're living up to
(41:31) your promise is it an important thing
(41:36) for you if it is and I feel it's
(41:40) probably the case that for many of you
(41:41) it is that very way of thinking that's
(41:44) part of the grammar that we have
(41:46) inherited from the Hebrews it's part of
(41:49) the very way we think it's part of the
(41:52) warp and woof of our cognition now we're
(41:57) going to come back to this strand we're
(42:01) going to come back and look at a
(42:02) particular way of understanding Kairos
(42:06) that became right central and
(42:10) Christianity because what Christianity
(42:11) did is it made a really radical claim it
(42:15) claimed that this Kairos was found in a
(42:18) particular person and what's that what
(42:22) that's going to do is it's going to
(42:23) personalize all of this in a really
(42:26) dramatic way but before we do that I
(42:30) want to switch back over to what's
(42:32) happening in a similar time in ancient
(42:35) Greece
(42:38) as I mentioned the psycho technology of
(42:43) alphabetic literacy is taken to the
(42:45) Greeks but the Greeks do something
(42:46) that's very important and it helps to
(42:48) explain right some of the differences we
(42:50) see in the Greek axial revolution from
(42:52) the ancient Hebrew actual revolution now
(42:57) the Greeks do something that again seems
(42:59) inconsequential now but they add vowels
(43:02) to the alphabet and it's like oh well so
(43:07) what well the thing is when you add
(43:10) vowels you really again increase how
(43:13) easy it is to process information so
(43:17) let's stop here because we need to be a
(43:18) cognitive science because this ease of
(43:21) processing really matters so I want to
(43:24) introduce you to an important idea from
(43:27) cognitive science this is the idea of
(43:29) cognitive fluency so we've got
(43:39) increasing experimental evidence for
(43:41) this basic kind of fact when you
(43:43) increase the ease at which people can
(43:45) process information regardless of what
(43:48) that information is
(43:49) they come to believe it is more real
(43:51) they have more confidence in it etc now
(43:55) that can be something very simple it can
(43:58) be as simple as changing the font
(44:00) contrast between the letters and the
(44:03) page so consider two individuals Tom and
(44:07) Susan Tom is reading our words in which
(44:11) the color contrasts between the letters
(44:13) and the page isn't as good as the color
(44:16) contrast that Susan's reading they're
(44:18) reading exactly the same thing they can
(44:20) both clearly read it it's just the font
(44:22) difference makes it easier for Susan
(44:24) than for Tom they read the same thing if
(44:30) you ask both of them well how true is
(44:32) what you read
(44:33) Susan's more likely to say that was true
(44:37) which is more likely to have confident
(44:39) in it regardless of the content the
(44:42) fluency of your processing actually
(44:45) increases your confidence in it your
(44:49) sense of how real
(44:51) the picture it's giving you is now it's
(44:55) not really ease in some simple sense
(44:57) because right it has to do more with how
(44:59) well your brain is accessing information
(45:01) applying it it's very complicated right
(45:04) but what I'm telling you is when I do
(45:07) something that increases your cognitive
(45:10) fluency you get an enhanced sense of
(45:14) your brain your brain get generates an
(45:16) enhanced sense that you're actually in
(45:18) touch with things we'll talk about this
(45:19) later that turns out to be a good policy
(45:21) your brain is using it's a very good
(45:24) idea for your brain to try and use the
(45:26) fluency of its own processing as a
(45:28) measure of how much it's in touch with
(45:30) reality by the way when you get a lot of
(45:36) fluency you of course are going to get
(45:39) into the flow State
(45:44) so when the Greeks introduce vowels they
(45:48) improve the fluency of alphabetic
(45:51) literacy they ramp up how powerful it is
(45:54) they also just introduced something else
(45:58) they introduced a standardized reading
(46:01) from left to right which you now take
(46:02) for granted many of you know that other
(46:05) languages go the other way
(46:07) Hebrews read this way for example that
(46:11) has an impact on your cognition first of
(46:12) all it's standardized that improves the
(46:14) fluency why does it improve your fluency
(46:16) when this is standard you know always if
(46:19) you look at Egyptian hieroglyphs they
(46:21) can go up they can go down they can go
(46:23) this way they can go that way when you
(46:25) standardize things that increases the
(46:27) fluency of the processing so they rats
(46:34) it up
(46:39) this power of literacy to enhance
(46:46) cognition they're also developing
(46:47) something else so the Greeks don't form
(46:50) a unified nation state they have
(46:52) individual city-states that are in
(46:53) competition with each other and in
(46:56) Athens in particular and oftens is going
(46:58) to be the hotbed of the axial revolution
(47:01) in Greece although not the only place in
(47:03) Athens you have slowly the emergence of
(47:06) democracy now it's it's a particularly
(47:12) problematic form of democracy it's
(47:13) direct democracy we'll talk about stuff
(47:15) like that later but what this does is
(47:18) this puts a premium on argumentation and
(47:20) debate so the Greeks start to sort of
(47:28) speed up the actual revolution of their
(47:30) own cognition they enhance the effects
(47:34) of alphabetic literacy they enhance
(47:36) write the use of reason and reflection
(47:41) and so they start to do things that
(47:44) again don't happen before lots of
(47:47) cultures were doing arithmetic but the
(47:50) Greeks invent mathematics they invent
(47:53) geometry they start to create abstract
(47:57) symbol systems for their own sake now
(48:02) that's what's going on in what's
(48:05) basically being invented in ancient
(48:10) Greece is this capacity for rational
(48:17) argumentation that's the psycho
(48:18) technology again you think of this no I
(48:23) want to be cleaner I'm not claiming that
(48:24) other groups or people are irrational or
(48:27) there can't be reasonable I'm not being
(48:29) ethnocentric but you get the explicit
(48:32) training of rational argumentation as a
(48:35) core psycho technology in ancient Greece
(48:41) now that is going to have very important
(48:45) consequences
(48:48) now it's interesting again is how this
(48:52) comes in to ancient Greece I'm going to
(48:57) introduce you to two individuals who are
(49:01) sort of the epitome of the axial
(49:05) revolution in Greece Pythagoras and
(49:09) Socrates you know Pythagoras of course
(49:13) because of an important mathematical
(49:14) theorem the Pythagorean theorem
(49:17) now Pythagoras is a very interesting
(49:20) person because he seems to be people he
(49:27) belongs to cornfield makes this argument
(49:28) very well right Cornford mixes argument
(49:36) very well he belongs to a group a group
(49:39) of individuals that are around you know
(49:42) sort of just coming out of that Dark Age
(49:44) around 600 BCE these these individuals
(49:47) were called the divine man it's pretty
(49:54) clear that these men seem to represent a
(49:58) rediscovery of shamanic psycho
(50:00) technologies they seem to they have a
(50:03) lot of associations with sort of
(50:05) capacities for healing for flying
(50:07) through the air and so a lot of this is
(50:09) is legendary
(50:11) right it's mythological that's not
(50:13) literal but Pythagoras is a real person
(50:18) now of course there's lots and lots of
(50:23) legendary material around him but the
(50:25) legend even points towards these
(50:27) important aspects he seems to have gone
(50:30) through shamanic training he engaged in
(50:33) something called the Thunderstone
(50:34) ceremony which involved him isolating
(50:37) himself in a cave and going through some
(50:39) radical transformation and then coming
(50:42) out of it he seems to have experienced
(50:45) soul flight because he talked about the
(50:48) capacity for the psyche to be liberated
(50:51) from the body
(50:55) he was very tall and he dressed like a
(50:57) god but no one found it offensive for
(51:00) him to do so at least not the people
(51:01) that followed him he discovers in this
(51:09) right he he discovers the octave he
(51:13) discovers that there's mathematical
(51:15) proportions in the world he comes to
(51:18) this realization that there's new psycho
(51:21) technologies of rational reflection and
(51:24) mathematics give us access to abstract
(51:27) patterns that we are not directly aware
(51:30) of like we all take it for granted that
(51:35) we know what an octave is and we know
(51:36) there can express by ratios but that was
(51:39) his discovery so what he does is he
(51:43) takes this idea about realizing through
(51:48) music and math these abstract patterns
(51:51) and then he links them to the project
(51:54) the shamanic
(51:54) ability to engage in self transcendence
(51:59) he comes up with the idea that were
(52:02) somehow trapped in this world but we can
(52:11) learn to fly above it we can fly free
(52:13) like the shaman but he's allied it
(52:18) explicitly to the actual project of self
(52:21) transcendence of getting in touch with
(52:24) the rationally realized patterns because
(52:29) that will liberate us that will change
(52:32) and transform us now Pythagoras gives us
(52:37) a lot of the words that we take for
(52:39) granted I said earlier that I didn't
(52:41) like calling the Prix axial world the
(52:43) cosmos because Pythagoras actually
(52:46) invents this word cosmos he's the first
(52:51) person to describe the universe as a
(52:54) cosmos now many of you probably treat
(52:57) those two terms as synonymous universe
(52:59) the one verse and cosmos they're not try
(53:05) to think of a word that's actually
(53:06) related to cosmos that
(53:08) familiar with so the word that might not
(53:13) come to mind is the word cosmetic
(53:16) cosmetics come from cosmos what it
(53:21) caused medics do they right reveal the
(53:25) beauty of things how beautiful and
(53:28) ordered they are so Pythagoras has the
(53:31) idea that if we go we can use music and
(53:35) mathematical thinking and practices that
(53:38) engage in this altered state of
(53:40) consciousness and he is integrating them
(53:42) all together it's not quite clear how
(53:43) but what we can do is we can transcend
(53:47) and see the world as beautiful and we're
(53:51) going to come back and talk about this
(53:53) how when people have awakening
(53:54) experiences they suddenly experience the
(53:56) world as a cosmos as radically beautiful
(54:02) now remember Pythagoras because he's
(54:06) gonna have a huge influence on somebody
(54:07) we're gonna talk about Plato but there's
(54:09) somebody who had an even greater
(54:11) influence on Plato and somebody who
(54:15) really epitomizes the axial revolution
(54:18) in ancient Greece in fact he has a
(54:22) revolution named after him this is
(54:25) called the Socratic revolution and the
(54:27) person we want to talk about is Socrates
(54:29) I'm going to argue how Socrates
(54:31) epitomizes the Greek form of the axial
(54:36) revolution and then what we're going to
(54:39) do is we're going to see how Plato takes
(54:41) Socrates and Pythagoras and puts them
(54:45) together and how Socratic and platonic
(54:49) your cognition is how it's part of the
(54:52) grammar of how you think
(54:55) but once again even though that's the
(54:58) grammar of how we understand meaning and
(55:01) wisdom and what a self is and how we how
(55:04) we grow how we self transcend how we get
(55:09) in touch with reality we are no longer
(55:14) in the worldview of Pythagoras do we do
(55:18) you actually
(55:21) I mean that's seriously do you actually
(55:25) experience the universe as a cosmos
(55:31) we'll take a look at that the next time
(55:34) we're together thank you very much for
(55:36) your time
(55:37) [Music]
(55:55) you
(55:57) you
