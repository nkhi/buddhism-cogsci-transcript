(00:00) [Music]
(00:04) you
(00:04) [Music]
(00:14) welcome to the fifth episode of
(00:17) awakening from the meeting crisis last
(00:18) time we talked about how the axial
(00:20) revolution came into greece we first
(00:23) reviewed Pythagoras and then we
(00:26) concentrated especially on the figure of
(00:28) Socrates and the Socratic revolution and
(00:30) we saw again how issues of meaning
(00:33) wisdom self transcendence are so tightly
(00:38) bound up together we took a look at
(00:40) Socrates and we took a look at how he
(00:43) has a particular conception of wisdom in
(00:46) which what we find salient irrelevant is
(00:49) closely closely coupled to what we find
(00:51) true or real and those two things those
(00:54) two concerns what is transformative of
(00:56) us and what is true of the world are
(00:58) meant to be held together and this was
(01:01) pivotal in Socrates's method of trying
(01:05) to get people to realize how much they
(01:08) all of us are so prone to having those
(01:11) two come uncoupled from each other and
(01:13) we become subject to [ __ ] and to
(01:16) self-deception and that a life that is
(01:18) beset by self deceptive self-destructive
(01:22) behavior is not a life that's worth
(01:23) living that way to afford human
(01:26) flourishing is by developing the skills
(01:30) the wisdom to keep those two tightly
(01:32) coupled together and Socrates was so
(01:34) convinced of how important this was in
(01:37) fact to making a life meaningful that he
(01:40) was prepared to die for it and as I
(01:42) mentioned there was somebody who was a
(01:44) follower of him who was at his trial not
(01:48) present at his death but was deeply
(01:50) traumatized and affected by his death
(01:53) and this is of course Plato
(01:55) now if Socrates was controversial Plato
(01:59) is beyond even that statement every year
(02:04) there are hundreds of books written
(02:06) about Plato this is why Plato is one of
(02:11) the foundations not only because of his
(02:13) ideas but as we'll see there's an
(02:15) inexhaustible nurse to Plato and his
(02:18) writing we can come back to Plato as a
(02:20) culture we come back at different times
(02:22) and see things we did not see before
(02:24) that are transformative and
(02:26) as individuals myself personally you can
(02:28) come back to Plato at different times of
(02:30) your life and Plato speaks to you in
(02:31) ways he did not speak before I want you
(02:34) to remember that because I'm gonna try
(02:36) and suggest to you that that is a better
(02:38) model for what we mean by something
(02:40) being sacred than it being filled with
(02:42) some kind of supernatural presence that
(02:45) what makes something sacred is that it's
(02:46) an inexhaustible fount of insight and
(02:49) intelligibility that's transformative of
(02:52) us that's certainly the way many people
(02:54) in the ancient world read Plato they
(02:57) were deeply affected by him I would go
(02:59) so far as to say the platonism are
(03:01) Neoplatonism as verse lewis and others
(03:04) argue is sort of the bedrock of Western
(03:08) spirituality and we'll come back to that
(03:10) now Plato was traumatized by the death
(03:15) of Socrates it's deeply I think
(03:18) disturbing to him why I think that is
(03:22) because he keeps coming back to it and
(03:24) and trying to try and understand he
(03:27) wanted to understand how is it that the
(03:30) city he loved the city he belonged to
(03:32) Athens could have killed this man that
(03:34) he admired and loved so deeply how is it
(03:38) that his beloved Athens killed his
(03:40) beloved Socrates so where where Socrates
(03:46) had this sort of dilemma given to him by
(03:48) the gods Plato has this dilemma given to
(03:51) him by the death of Socrates Plato
(03:55) wanted to understand how people could be
(03:57) so foolish and so what he's gonna do is
(04:02) he's gonna take that two worlds
(04:03) mythology that we talked about the the
(04:05) lower less real world and remember it's
(04:07) myth mythological it's not meant to be
(04:09) literally two worlds but he's gonna take
(04:12) that two worlds mythology and he's going
(04:14) to do something with it very different
(04:16) than what the Hebrews did remember the
(04:18) Hebrews turned it into this is where
(04:20) things are fallen now but we're moving
(04:23) towards the future we're progressing
(04:25) towards the future so they give a
(04:27) historical answer to how we move from
(04:31) the world of illusion to the world of
(04:33) reality Plato is not going to give a
(04:36) historical answer he's he's
(04:38) to give a scientific answer because
(04:41) Plato is deeply influenced by the
(04:43) natural philosophers that we talked
(04:45) about last time and what Plato is in
(04:49) fact going to do is he's going to create
(04:50) the first psychological theory in
(04:52) history with Plato you can really see
(04:54) the beginning not just of science but
(04:56) the beginning of cognitive science
(04:57) psychology as a discipline begins in a
(05:01) very important sense and I don't mean
(05:03) this trivially like oh yeah it started
(05:05) with that
(05:06) Plato's psychology is still currently
(05:09) relevant right now in important ways
(05:12) which we'll talk about so let's get into
(05:15) that because this is again going to take
(05:18) us into these interconnected issues of
(05:20) meaning wisdom self transcendence
(05:24) altered states of consciousness etc I'm
(05:29) gonna hope to show you how Plato in
(05:31) trying to answer the question of how
(05:34) Athens could have killed Socrates is
(05:36) ultimately influenced not just by
(05:39) Socrates but also by Pythagoras we know
(05:42) that Plato spent some time with a
(05:44) Pythagorean community and he seems to
(05:47) have gone through something some kind of
(05:50) training in that community so Plato
(05:55) develops a particular theory about why
(05:59) human beings do foolish things when
(06:04) there's different aspects of it but a
(06:07) good way to think about it is by
(06:11) relating it to something that we're all
(06:12) familiar with this is the experience of
(06:15) inner conflict and a conflict is when
(06:19) you have two strong motives that seem to
(06:22) be working against each other and you
(06:24) can see how this is immediately going to
(06:25) be relevant to existential meaning -
(06:27) meaning in life because very often we
(06:30) feel most distraught most anxious or the
(06:35) most sense of being stuck when we have
(06:38) such inner conflict when we're divided
(06:40) against ourselves in an important way so
(06:45) here's a classic example right so I like
(06:49) chocolate
(06:50) I'm more than like chocolate chocolate
(06:52) mmm has a kind of deep attraction for me
(06:57) so now recently I lost about 20 pounds
(07:01) right so I went on a diet now dieting is
(07:05) one of the most unsuccessful thing that
(07:06) human beings can do the recidivism rate
(07:10) is 95% recidivism means that within a
(07:12) year 95% of people who are on a diet are
(07:15) back to their pre diet weight so the
(07:18) diet industry has a five percent success
(07:20) rate even though it makes billions of
(07:23) dollars I mean I wish I had that success
(07:26) rate for my job I wish I only had to
(07:28) succeed at 5% and I was given millions
(07:31) of dollars for that kind of work because
(07:35) and you have to ask yourself well why
(07:36) does that work well that works because
(07:38) of the problem it's such a pressing
(07:41) problem that people will grasp and pay
(07:43) money and anything in the hopes that it
(07:44) might work because what's the problem
(07:46) well the problem is right it goes like
(07:49) this and we'll talk about the cognitive
(07:50) science about this I know I should lose
(07:53) weight like there's the evidence it's
(07:56) clear makes rational sense to me I
(07:58) should lose weight yes yes okay I should
(08:01) lose weight and then I go home and
(08:03) they're sitting on the counter there's
(08:05) some chocolate cake right and and and
(08:09) that doesn't quite capture right it's
(08:10) not just sitting there it's like it's a
(08:13) it's like how men with its chocolaty
(08:16) goodness right and it's drawing me in
(08:19) it's sort of and so you have to you end
(08:24) up sort of often just eating the
(08:26) chocolate cake or another example you
(08:29) might be familiar with procrastination I
(08:33) know my students face this right yes yes
(08:38) I have an essay due in two weeks two
(08:42) weeks there it is I should work on my
(08:44) essay tonight because if I start now I
(08:46) won't be rushed I know if I'm not rushed
(08:48) I'll do a great job I'll have more time
(08:50) to research I'll be able to change my
(08:51) mind I should start working on my essay
(08:54) tonight nobody calls up want to go up
(08:57) for some drinks yeah and you're gone and
(08:59) you procrastinate
(09:01) so we are clearly beset by this inner
(09:08) conflict and Plato Plato gets this great
(09:11) insight he gets the insight that there
(09:14) seems to be a deep connection between
(09:15) inner conflict and self-deception
(09:19) self-destructive self-deception so Plato
(09:24) posits an idea that has become again so
(09:28) natural to us that we just think oh yeah
(09:30) of course but again he comes up with it
(09:34) pedda comes up with the idea that we
(09:36) have different centers in the psyche and
(09:41) each Center has a different cognitive
(09:44) relationship to the world and motivates
(09:46) us in different ways and he represented
(09:48) this mythologically right
(09:51) he said there's like a part of us that's
(09:54) like a man I want to say something here
(09:56) right now because although Athenian
(09:59) democracy is horribly sexist and treats
(10:02) women horribly and so remember that
(10:05) context because what's intriguing is how
(10:07) much Plato was able to rise above that
(10:11) Plato argues that women should rule as
(10:14) well as men that women should be in the
(10:16) army as well as men now he doesn't
(10:18) perfectly free himself of course from
(10:20) sexism but given the context I think
(10:23) it's very admirable the degree to which
(10:25) he was able to do it nevertheless he
(10:28) does use this idea of a man that's in
(10:30) your head and represents reasoned and
(10:38) that man is motivated by the true by
(10:41) truth what's true so he cares about
(10:46) truth and falsity that's what it cares
(10:48) about right and right scope right you
(10:52) can go into very long-term goals
(10:58) and it can deal with very abstract
(11:02) entities like your health or a si all
(11:07) right very abstract entities so this is
(11:14) you know health and I should lose weight
(11:18) that's going to take me several months
(11:20) and I should do that because it's true
(11:22) that if I lose weight my health will
(11:24) improve so why don't I just do it well
(11:28) because opposed to it there's a monster
(11:31) right and it's sort of in my stomach and
(11:37) genitals right and it represents
(11:43) appetite
(11:52) now it does not work in terms of truth
(11:54) and falsity it works in terms of
(11:56) pleasure and pain very different set of
(12:04) norms now there's nothing wrong with
(12:06) operating in terms of pleasure and pain
(12:08) if you don't have a capacity to work in
(12:12) terms of pleasure and pain your dad so
(12:14) Plato doesn't think the appetites are
(12:16) evil what he wants you to grasp is that
(12:19) they operate according to different
(12:21) principles than the man okay so they
(12:23) presume long-term goals no immediate
(12:29) when do you want the cake I want it now
(12:31) now I'm going to the party now right
(12:39) works in vary it doesn't it works in
(12:42) terms of very superficial properties all
(12:44) I care about the cake is how it looks it
(12:46) looks yummy
(12:47) I don't have some in-depth analysis
(12:50) right it's just ah chocolatey sweet umm
(12:54) so very superficial again that's not
(13:00) necessarily bad often in life and death
(13:04) situations a superficial appraisal is
(13:07) exactly what you need I don't need to
(13:09) know a great deal about the inner
(13:12) workings of the tiger I just need to
(13:14) know oh crap deadly get out of here okay
(13:21) now notice how these are opposite to
(13:26) each other now I put a space between
(13:30) here obviously because I'm setting you
(13:31) up for a third thing that Plato talks
(13:33) about but before I do I wanted you to
(13:36) notice what Plato's doing with Socrates
(13:38) here so Socrates didn't really have a
(13:41) theory he had a practice Socrates
(13:43) practice if you remember last time was
(13:45) to get people to realize how often what
(13:48) they find salient is rushing ahead of
(13:51) what they find truthful do you remember
(13:53) that
(13:55) what Plato is saying is that's not a
(13:58) coincidence the reason why that happens
(14:01) is because we have different parts of
(14:04) the psyche that work this way
(14:06) this makes things salient to you really
(14:09) catchy motivates you urgently right now
(14:12) this is the part that you use to
(14:14) understand and see here's what most of
(14:17) us face this monster is constantly
(14:20) racing ahead of what we understand do
(14:24) you see what Plato is doing is it's
(14:27) explaining why we are so prone to
(14:29) [ __ ]
(14:30) why salience often exceeds understanding
(14:33) we are perpetually vulnerable and we'll
(14:36) talk about why we have this now let's go
(14:41) back to the dieting as an example what
(14:43) what helps though there's certain
(14:45) strategies you can use of course to
(14:47) improve right how you frame things and
(14:50) we'll talk about that later but
(14:52) typically what's one of the things that
(14:54) improves people's chances of losing
(14:56) weight they join a group like Weight
(14:59) Watchers right or they join a study
(15:03) group to avoid the procrastination why
(15:07) well here's an important thing you are
(15:11) not just a biological creature as I've
(15:14) been arguing throughout you're also
(15:16) cultural you have evolved across you are
(15:19) the result of evolution that has crossed
(15:21) several species in which you come wired
(15:24) to learn about abstract symbol systems
(15:26) use technologies both physical and
(15:29) psychic knowledge ease so you have a lot
(15:33) of powerful cultural cultural
(15:35) socio-cultural motivations so he
(15:42) compared this to a lion because lions
(15:47) are social animals quite sort of and
(15:50) lions have been associated with sort of
(15:52) honor because that's and right that's
(15:58) what this works in terms of it works in
(16:00) terms of honor and shame
(16:06) right honor is to be respected by those
(16:08) you consider your peers to be shame is
(16:12) when you feel that you have failed to be
(16:15) gained respect from your peers we should
(16:18) not confuse shame and guilt they are not
(16:23) synonyms right guilt is when you feel
(16:26) that you have failed to meet your own
(16:28) ideal of who you should be shame is when
(16:32) you have lost the capacity to get
(16:35) respect from your peers now what's
(16:42) interesting is that and this is Plato's
(16:46) point but this part of us can pursue
(16:50) sort of intermediate scope because we're
(16:52) cooperating with other people it doesn't
(16:55) operate just a short term but it doesn't
(16:58) quite operate abstract theoretical it
(17:01) ought it works within the socio-cultural
(17:03) domain so it can pursue sort of midterm
(17:10) goals not just immediate goals but not
(17:14) sort of abstract symbolic goals but
(17:16) socially agreed-upon shared goals and it
(17:23) works on sort of the cultural aspects of
(17:27) things not their abstract meaning or
(17:29) their superficial meaning but their
(17:30) cultural their shared meaning the way we
(17:32) can share it with other people notice
(17:34) how much you want to share with other
(17:36) people your experience so I I see I've
(17:41) been saying this for years I still see
(17:43) people doing it even people that I've
(17:44) taught it to people will reliably do
(17:46) this they'll be eating something they'll
(17:49) trying it for the first time and they'll
(17:50) go oh this tastes horrible have some
(17:53) they'll give it to somebody else because
(17:56) you want to have that in addition to
(17:59) whatever immediate response you're
(18:01) having you want there to be a shared
(18:03) cultural meaning to what's happening in
(18:05) your experience and there's good reason
(18:07) for that because as I've been arguing
(18:09) throughout your connection to
(18:11) distributed cognition is one of the most
(18:13) powerful ways you increase your
(18:15) cognitive power over the world
(18:19) now he there he sort of represents this
(18:25) as being like in the chest and this has
(18:28) to do because we we feel mm-hm our
(18:31) social emotions and motivation in the
(18:34) chest you know your pride and honor and
(18:37) you know you know shame right things
(18:40) like that
(18:42) now this is problematic for us what
(18:47) should go there because the Greek word
(18:52) doesn't have a direct English equivalent
(18:54) sometimes people put emotion there
(18:56) that's not quite right sometimes people
(18:58) put the word spirit there that's closer
(19:01) but the problem with spirit is it has
(19:02) all kinds of spooky associations with it
(19:04) all right I'm not going to translate it
(19:07) I'm just going to leave it as is this is
(19:10) your Phi Moss this is the part of you
(19:13) that is motivated socially so here's an
(19:20) interesting idea Plato has all right
(19:25) they there is a lot of potential
(19:27) conflict in this system it's a lot of
(19:30) potential conflict in this system what
(19:33) you want to do is get it properly
(19:36) ordered now when you don't order it
(19:43) think about what this means
(19:46) salience and understanding and
(19:49) participation get out of sync with each
(19:52) other and then we're subject to
(19:54) bullshitting were subject to
(19:56) self-deception the more inner conflict
(19:58) we have the more likely we are to engage
(20:01) in self-deception because these two are
(20:04) zinc and the more likely we will become
(20:07) very egocentric so when people are
(20:09) suffering especially inner conflict
(20:12) anxiety they tend to become more
(20:13) self-centered even selfish because when
(20:17) you're experiencing inner conflict
(20:19) you're getting sort of a threat signal
(20:20) some things aren't right and when people
(20:23) are under threat they tend to become
(20:24) very egocentric again that's adaptive
(20:30) now we're gonna come back to this but we
(20:36) want to do a little bit of cognitive
(20:36) science well why do like why do we like
(20:39) what why okay it makes sense that right
(20:43) we have this as a motivation because
(20:45) we're social creatures right one of our
(20:48) greatest adaptation is our ability to
(20:50) cooperate together so you know you throw
(20:55) me into the African savanna on my own
(20:57) and I'm dead soon because like I don't
(20:59) have great claws I don't have great
(21:01) teeth
(21:02) I'm look at what is sillies structure
(21:04) right on teetering around on two feet
(21:05) almost always losing my balance
(21:07) I can't run quickly everybody can see me
(21:09) from a long distance because I'm
(21:10) towering above the grass my throat and
(21:13) my vital organs are nicely exposed for
(21:15) any predator this is a bad okay but you
(21:21) know what I can do I can get together
(21:23) with a bunch of other human beings and
(21:25) we can get some pointy sticks and some
(21:27) dogs and then we can kill everything on
(21:28) the planet our ability to work together
(21:33) has always been adaptive so we know why
(21:36) this is here why is but why does this
(21:42) have so much more power than this well
(21:46) there's there's a there's an actually an
(21:48) important reason and this has to do with
(21:55) from work started by Ainsley and others
(21:58) on what's called hyperbolic discounting
(22:01) or temporal discounting and what Ainsley
(22:04) and other people found is this pattern
(22:07) of behavior is exist across species it's
(22:12) not just something that human beings
(22:13) engage and you can find it across
(22:14) species it's even more Universal than
(22:16) something like flow it's not just
(22:18) Universal amongst human beings it's
(22:20) Universal across many species so in this
(22:22) is a deeply adaptive mechanism what does
(22:24) this mechanism look like okay so this is
(22:30) called discounting and this is a little
(22:33) bit confusing discounting is how much
(22:35) you are reducing the salience of a
(22:37) stimulus the more you discount the less
(22:40) salient something is the less it stands
(22:42) out for you the less it grabs your
(22:44) attention this axis is tying in a tenth
(22:48) sense this is the present and this is
(22:50) the future so what I'm showing you is
(22:54) what's happening to discounting which
(22:55) means how much a stimulus is losing its
(22:58) salience and this is what it looks like
(23:00) is what the curve looks like okay so a
(23:05) present stimulus has a large degree of
(23:08) salience to it remember the monster
(23:10) something that's in the future
(23:12) especially as it gets into the far
(23:14) future much less salience to it that's
(23:18) why the monster can override the man but
(23:22) why why don't we like why do we have
(23:25) this well this is actually very very
(23:26) adaptive that's why it's a universal
(23:30) phenomenon how is it adaptive so I want
(23:35) you to think about doing your you're
(23:39) about to do something here I don't smoke
(23:43) I do diet but I don't smoke but let's
(23:45) suppose I was doing this here's right
(23:48) now and I decide to smoke a cigarette
(23:52) right and that could have one of two
(23:55) options right you know I get a coffee
(24:00) roar I don't get a cough there or
(24:02) something like that right now notice and
(24:04) I'm doing this very simplistically I'm
(24:06) not saying that whenever you do
(24:07) something there's only two effects from
(24:09) I'm just doing it simplistic in a very
(24:11) simple manner so you can understand the
(24:13) point okay
(24:14) now the probability of now happening is
(24:17) a hundred percent because it's happening
(24:18) the probability of each one of these
(24:20) happening is 50% now when if I were if
(24:23) it goes this way and then there's two
(24:25) more effects the probability of each one
(24:27) of these is 25 right and so on so do you
(24:31) see what's happening as you move into
(24:35) the future the probability of any one of
(24:38) these events occurring is going down
(24:40) very fast now here's the thing this is
(24:46) this is actually adaptive you should pay
(24:49) less attention to things that are less
(24:50) probable than happening that actually
(24:54) makes good sense the less probable
(24:56) something and of
(24:57) tis the less attention you should give
(24:59) it imagine if you didn't have this
(25:02) imagine if you didn't screen off things
(25:04) that were low in probability think about
(25:07) how you would be overwhelmed by all the
(25:09) possibilities so if I get out of bed I
(25:13) might twist my ankle slightly and that
(25:15) might slow me down getting to class and
(25:17) if I slow down getting to class that
(25:19) might have an impact on my mark and that
(25:21) might cause me to fail my course and
(25:25) then if I fail my course that might
(25:27) disrupt my degree and that might cause
(25:30) me to failed in my career and and then
(25:32) I'm going to end up in Buffalo alone
(25:34) married to a lamp or something now
(25:38) that's ridiculous right now it's
(25:40) possible it's not impossible except the
(25:43) last part you can't really get married
(25:44) to a lamp but right in fact here's a
(25:52) hypothesis I have no notice the word I
(25:54) used please I think one of the things
(25:58) that goes wrong in people who experience
(26:00) generalized anxiety disorder is that
(26:03) this is not working well enough it's not
(26:06) screening off and making low salient low
(26:09) probability events so how the anxious
(26:12) people find things salient that they
(26:15) shouldn't they find low probability
(26:17) things too salient so this is really
(26:21) adaptive this is why you have it but
(26:25) there's a problem with it and this is a
(26:26) problem with any adaptive machine and
(26:28) you're gonna see later why this is the
(26:30) case ok let's go back to the cigarette
(26:33) smoker I smoked and through a long chain
(26:36) this is me dying in Hamilton right this
(26:42) is the event of me dying in Hamilton
(26:43) lung cancer in my left lung I'm not
(26:51) going to write these all out this is me
(26:53) dying in Hamilton of cancer and my right
(26:55) lung this is me dying in Toronto cancer
(26:58) left right this is me dying in
(26:59) Burlington because and so on there's all
(27:02) these different deaths now here's the
(27:04) thing each one of those deaths has a low
(27:06) probability of occurring right you see
(27:09) that each one of those death
(27:11) has a low probability of occurring but
(27:13) here's the thing about me and I bet you
(27:15) I share it with you I don't want to just
(27:17) avoid death in Hamilton oh that would
(27:19) although that would be a particularly
(27:20) about death I don't want to avoid just
(27:22) dying in Hamilton I'm from Hamilton so
(27:24) I'm allowed to do that
(27:25) I want to avoid death I want to avoid
(27:30) all these deaths think carefully and I'm
(27:34) using this very technically but I'm
(27:35) speaking accurately I want to avoid
(27:37) death in the abstract I don't want to
(27:40) avoid this death or this death or this
(27:44) death or this death I want to avoid all
(27:47) possible deaths
(27:49) I want to avoid death in the abstract
(27:53) now here's the thing the chance of dot
(27:57) each one of these deaths is very low but
(28:00) if you pull them together the chance
(28:02) that cigarette smoking will lead to a
(28:04) premature death is very very high okay
(28:08) so what does that mean for me the
(28:13) hyperbolic discounting blinds me to this
(28:15) because it's not very probable blinds me
(28:18) to this because it's not very probable
(28:19) blinds me to each one of these because
(28:21) each individually they're not very
(28:23) probable but in blinding me to each you
(28:25) know what it blinds me to what they
(28:27) share in common it blinds me to what
(28:29) they all have in common and what they
(28:31) all have in common is a premature death
(28:35) by blinding me to what they have in
(28:38) common what they abstractly share this
(28:42) adaptive machine actually has me take
(28:44) another puff on the cigarette and sets
(28:47) me on the course towards cancer or
(28:49) emphysema DC now please remember this
(28:55) this is going to be a theme we're going
(28:57) to be coming back to again and again and
(28:59) again I mentioned it before when I
(29:00) talked about flow the very machinery
(29:02) that makes you adaptive is the machinery
(29:05) that makes you pray to self deceptive
(29:08) self-destructive behavior part of what
(29:11) meaning and wisdom have to do is they
(29:13) have to wrestle with that unavoidable
(29:15) reality the unavoidable reality is you
(29:18) can't you can't throw this away you
(29:21) can't throw away this machinery because
(29:22) if you throw this adaptive machinery
(29:24) away your
(29:25) doomed you can't get out of bed because
(29:26) you're overwhelmed by crippling anxiety
(29:29) you can't throw it away but you can't
(29:31) just let it run untutored because then
(29:33) you smoke the cigarette you eat the cake
(29:36) you go to the party and you harm
(29:39) yourself in a septa self-deceptive
(29:41) self-destructive fashion so what do you
(29:46) need to do here's the monster what you
(29:51) need and what we developed is we
(29:54) developed an ability especially here
(29:59) frontal lobe area to form abstract
(30:04) thought to abstract what is in common in
(30:08) the distant future and symbolically
(30:11) represent it to ourselves that's what
(30:15) the man does the man can grasp the
(30:17) abstract thought of avoiding the
(30:19) premature death but you say but but the
(30:23) man is so weak the man's weak because
(30:25) you don't want him to be able to shut
(30:27) this off you want him to be able to
(30:31) override it but in a very minimal sense
(30:34) because that's so adaptive see so Plato
(30:37) is deeply right so in fact I think Plato
(30:42) is so deeply right that's what we keep
(30:43) discovering this division Freud divides
(30:46) the psyche into these three things a
(30:48) super-ego the ego the it'd you know
(30:50) there's there's a movement in the 90s
(30:53) and neuroscience to talk about you know
(30:54) the reptilian brain the mammal brain and
(30:57) the Neo core we keep rediscovering this
(30:58) platonic division the Plato had an
(31:03) interesting idea
(31:05) [Music]
(31:12) he said you know what the man can learn
(31:16) the man is capable of grasping theory
(31:21) abstract symbolic representation of the
(31:26) case now the lion really isn't capable
(31:31) of theory but what the lion can be do is
(31:34) the lion can be trained you can use your
(31:38) reason to train your lion how do you do
(31:41) this well this is this is this is where
(31:44) Socrates is so relevant right and this
(31:49) is this is why Plato writes dialogues
(31:51) because what Socrates did was he took
(31:55) reason into the social arena
(31:58) Socrates goes into the marketplace and
(32:01) dialogues with people there's this
(32:04) social interaction is happening and the
(32:07) social interaction is being read to
(32:09) rational reflection and to inspiring
(32:12) people to try and overcome
(32:15) self-deception and so using a Socratic
(32:19) method the man can train the lion and
(32:26) then the man and the lion together can
(32:30) tame the monster not kill it
(32:33) but tame it and what you want is you
(32:40) want that keep that teaching of the man
(32:44) the training of the line and the taming
(32:47) of the monster so that something happens
(32:49) you reduce as much as possible the inner
(32:52) conflict so this is like for Plato Plato
(32:56) describes wisdom as an internal justice
(32:58) within the psyche in which the man has
(33:01) been taught the line has been trained
(33:03) and that their monster has been tamed so
(33:05) they can get along together as much as
(33:07) is possible since this is what's known
(33:13) as an optimization strategy right if I
(33:16) let the monster rule everything else
(33:20) shrinks to a minimum what you want is
(33:23) you want the
(33:24) coordination of the parts of the psyche
(33:28) so that each can live as much as it
(33:30) possibly can without putting the other
(33:32) two in danger when you can get that
(33:34) inner harmony that optimal relation so
(33:37) each is living is that much as it can
(33:39) without putting the other ones in danger
(33:42) this mutuality of the most existence
(33:45) this is for Plato this is to experience
(33:47) a fullness of being this is to be as
(33:50) fully alive as you possibly can be
(33:53) it is also to expend experience a kind
(33:55) of peace because your inner conflict has
(33:58) dropped so this is this is very powerful
(34:02) one of one of your meta drives in
(34:06) addition to all the drives people have
(34:08) they want to have whatever they're
(34:10) having without inner conflict they want
(34:12) to be at peace with themselves now this
(34:19) of course is a powerful meta Drive that
(34:24) you can tap into because if you have a
(34:28) strong drive within you to get this
(34:31) inner justice to realize wisdom to get
(34:33) this fullness of being then I can appeal
(34:35) to it I can appeal to it Socratic aliy
(34:40) but notice that this has this has this
(34:43) has an important component to it because
(34:46) as I reduce inner conflict my
(34:49) self-deception goes down and as I reduce
(34:52) my inner conflict I'm less egocentric
(34:55) both of these things are making me more
(34:58) in touch with reality so I'm reducing
(35:02) inner conflict
(35:08) but the effect that's having is right
(35:10) I'm getting a clearer vision of reality
(35:16) because my self-deception an egocentric
(35:18) egocentrism is going down now that
(35:22) matters because as we've seen before you
(35:25) want to be in touch with reality
(35:27) you have a meta Drive philosophers have
(35:32) various thought experiments for talking
(35:34) about this no one else sometimes do with
(35:37) students is I'll say imagine the
(35:39) following right you go home one day and
(35:42) your parents say
(35:43) I'll come won't come here I want to show
(35:44) you something when you say what and they
(35:47) take you to this hallway that you've
(35:49) walked out a thousand times before and
(35:52) they they press on a part on the wall
(35:55) that for you is never meant anything and
(35:57) when they press a door opens and there's
(35:59) a room in there and there's TV screens
(36:01) and there's video tape and there's
(36:03) pictures of you at all stages of your
(36:04) life and then they say the following to
(36:06) you just before you were born nine
(36:12) months before you were born we were
(36:13) hired by the government to have you this
(36:16) is part of an experiment the government
(36:18) gave us scripts to memorize and we did
(36:21) this as we write as a part of a
(36:25) government experiment experiment we
(36:27) don't actually love you or care about
(36:29) you at all we've just been following the
(36:31) script doing what we've been doing
(36:34) because the government has hired us to
(36:35) do this and what but we're obligated now
(36:38) that you've turned 21 or whatever to
(36:40) tell you the truth we don't care about
(36:42) you now we still have to keep doing this
(36:45) when we'll leave the room we can forget
(36:48) all about this if you want right and
(36:51) we'll just say that we what we've always
(36:53) said we'll tell you how much we love you
(36:55) we'll make sure that your needs are met
(36:56) just know right now that none of that is
(36:59) how we truly feel okay now ask people
(37:04) how would you feel and they'd go well
(37:06) I'd be devastated but but I say but
(37:09) nothing's changed they're gonna still
(37:11) say all the same words to you they're
(37:13) still gonna treat you exactly the same
(37:14) way and what people say is well it's no
(37:16) longer real here's another thing I'll
(37:20) deal with people I'll say
(37:22) how many of you are in satisfying
(37:24) personal relationships quite a few
(37:26) people put up their hands and then I'll
(37:28) say how many of you would want to know
(37:30) that your partner was cheating on you
(37:32) even if that meant the destruction of
(37:33) your relationship almost everybody puts
(37:36) their hand up they're willing to destroy
(37:39) this relationship that's giving them so
(37:41) much happiness because they don't want
(37:45) it to be fake they want it to be real
(37:49) and we'll talk a lot we'll talk later
(37:51) about why this need to be real is so
(37:54) important but I want you to understand
(38:02) what Plato is talking about here notice
(38:06) that two of your most important meta
(38:08) drives are being met in the Platonic
(38:09) model you're reducing inner conflict and
(38:13) you're becoming more in touch with
(38:15) reality now that that feeds on itself in
(38:21) an important way I get better on picking
(38:26) up on real patterns in the world my
(38:31) skill at picking up on real patterns is
(38:34) improved because I get a clearer vision
(38:37) I get better at tracking real patterns
(38:39) right but what does that mean well as I
(38:46) start to get more inner peace I start to
(38:51) be able to pick up on real patterns I
(38:53) get the skill the vision ability but of
(39:00) course what I can do is I can apply that
(39:02) to myself
(39:04) Socratic self-knowledge as I get better
(39:07) at picking up on real patterns I can
(39:09) apply that to myself I can get better
(39:11) knowledge of myself as I get better
(39:15) knowledge of myself I can better teach
(39:19) the man when you to be a good teacher
(39:23) you have to know your student better as
(39:25) I get better knowledge of myself I can
(39:27) teach the man I can better train the
(39:29) lion I can better tame the monster so
(39:33) notice what's happening here
(39:35) I improve a little bit my skill at
(39:37) picking up on real patterns I use that
(39:40) skill on myself to increase my
(39:42) self-knowledge and get better patterns
(39:44) which means I reduce my inner conflict
(39:46) as my inner conflict goes down I get a
(39:49) clearer vision of reality as I get a
(39:52) clearer vision of reality I get better
(39:54) at picking up on real patterns which
(39:56) means I improve myself knowledge which
(39:59) means I reduce my inner conflict and you
(40:01) see what happens this starts to spin
(40:03) like this these two sides feed into each
(40:06) other and reinforce each other and
(40:08) improve each other and this is wonderful
(40:11) for you because you're becoming less
(40:15) inner conflicted and you're coming more
(40:18) in contact with reality now Plato has a
(40:22) famous story a parable a myth in the
(40:27) sense that I'm talking about in this
(40:29) court in this series it's called the
(40:33) parable or the myth of the cave and it's
(40:36) a way of talking about this the
(40:41) relationship between these things notice
(40:45) two things here you need to remember
(40:48) this notice how much self transformation
(40:51) and getting more in contact with the
(40:55) world are interconnected this is
(40:58) participatory lower knowing I'm not over
(41:01) here as an impartial impassive sorry
(41:03) impart impartial passive observer just
(41:06) forming true beliefs about this I have
(41:08) to change myself in order to see the
(41:12) world and then the world changes and
(41:14) then that puts a demand on me to change
(41:16) myself and as I change myself the world
(41:19) discloses itself in a new way and so on
(41:21) and so forth
(41:23) this is participatory knowing I'm not
(41:27) just changing my mind this is not just
(41:29) knowing with my mind this is knowing
(41:30) with the very machinery of my self
(41:33) now what's plato's myth so here's the
(41:38) surface right pathway going down
(41:44) all right that leads into this inner
(41:46) cavern right there's a fire here alright
(41:53) there's people chained to chairs so all
(41:56) they can do is look at the back of the
(41:58) cave then there's other people walking
(42:05) in front of the fire and it's casting
(42:08) shadows onto the cave because of the
(42:11) firelight and they're hearing the echoes
(42:13) and what Plato says is people take the
(42:19) shadows and the echoes to be the real
(42:21) things because they're chained they're
(42:24) caught up but what happens is an
(42:31) individual gets free and what does that
(42:37) individual do that individual turns and
(42:41) sees the fire and that allows them to
(42:46) realize that the shadows and the echoes
(42:48) aren't the real things the shadows and
(42:51) echoes and what happens is the person's
(42:55) ability to notice the real patterns as
(42:58) opposed to the merely correlational
(43:01) patterns is changed remember we talked
(43:03) about that people start to see they
(43:07) start to realize oh these are what real
(43:09) patterns feel like as opposed to what I
(43:11) thought was real you get the taste for
(43:14) reality development and that taste means
(43:16) they start to look around and explore
(43:18) and then they realize there's a path
(43:21) there's light coming through it and then
(43:24) they start a journey upward now notice
(43:27) how this journey works when they take a
(43:29) step forward they're blinded by the
(43:31) light and they have to wait they have to
(43:34) wait for their eyes to adjust the self
(43:36) has to be transformed and then once the
(43:38) eyes have adjusted they can see how to
(43:40) go and then they take another step and
(43:42) then they're blinded again and there's
(43:44) this slow process and Plato keep talking
(43:47) about at various stages they have to
(43:48) stop because they're blinded and then
(43:51) they adjust and then they gain the
(43:53) ability to see where they couldn't see
(43:54) before it's this participatory
(43:56) transformation
(43:57) I talked about it and eventually you
(43:59) come up here and they look around right
(44:08) and what what are they looking for they
(44:12) want to see the source of the real light
(44:15) the light that's making them allowing
(44:18) them to pick up on the real patterns
(44:19) where is this light that shows the
(44:21) reality of things coming from and not
(44:23) only is it showing the reality of things
(44:26) this light is the source of the life of
(44:28) things where is this source of
(44:32) understanding and life and if they look
(44:34) around and of course they glimpse
(44:37) because I can't stare at it directly the
(44:39) Sun and it's overwhelming it's beyond
(44:42) their comprehension but they see it and
(44:49) it that fills them or they're kind of
(44:52) off and of course what they do is they
(44:54) go back down into the tunnel rapidly
(44:57) right and they get here and they try to
(44:59) tell their fellow prisoners what they
(45:03) saw but of course they're stumbling
(45:04) around because their eyes don't work
(45:07) anymore in that darkness and they're
(45:09) saying things that don't make absolutely
(45:10) no sense to these people and so they
(45:13) ridicule them and if they could they
(45:14) would kill that individual and of course
(45:16) this is an allusion to Socrates now
(45:22) first of all notice that contrary to
(45:25) what people think enlightenment is not
(45:28) just an Eastern idea this is a myth of
(45:34) enlightenment of coming into the light
(45:43) it's a myth of self transcendence and
(45:45) self transformation it's a myth of
(45:48) coming and I mean myth in the sense that
(45:50) we've been talking about it's a parable
(45:53) of coming in to greater and greater
(45:55) contact with reality to see notice the
(45:58) story is right you pick up on real
(46:01) patterns that challenges you it sort of
(46:03) blinds you and then you transform to
(46:05) pick them up and then you're enabled to
(46:07) move forward then you confront those
(46:09) real patterns again and you're doing
(46:11) that cycle that I talked about there's a
(46:13) Greek word for this ascent called
(46:18) an agog a and a GOG II this is the
(46:25) anagogical
(46:26) or the anagogical aspect of Plato's idea
(46:31) notice what he's doing he's taking the
(46:35) you know the movement between the
(46:37) illusory world and the real world and
(46:40) he's turning it into this account of how
(46:44) you can make your lives rationally more
(46:47) meaningful you can become more fully
(46:51) alive and more at peace in conjunction
(46:54) in concert with you coming more and more
(46:57) in contact with the real patterns that
(47:00) make sense of reality you can satisfy in
(47:04) a mutually supporting fashion your
(47:06) desire your Metta drive for inner peace
(47:08) and your Metta drive to be in contact
(47:11) with reality this is what Plato calls
(47:13) wisdom a fullness of being we become
(47:17) more and more real or self ourselves as
(47:20) become more and more at peace so that we
(47:23) can more and more realize the real
(47:25) patterns we conform ourselves more and
(47:27) more to reality and you may say this is
(47:32) kind of a crazy story is it is it
(47:36) because here's a story from 1999 there's
(47:39) all these people and they're trapped in
(47:41) a world of shadows and unreality it's
(47:45) called the matrix and they need to wake
(47:50) up and be welcomed to the real world and
(47:52) the character that's in there is neo
(47:57) from Neoplatonism the new man people
(48:08) flock to that movie and all it is is
(48:11) this with some great martial arts and
(48:14) some interesting science-fiction special
(48:15) effects this parable this is what I mean
(48:21) about a myth this isn't a story from the
(48:23) past right the reason why you go to The
(48:27) Matrix and people still watch it and
(48:28) talk about it is because it's a myth it
(48:31) seems to you it speaks to you now
(48:33) because it talks about perennial
(48:35) problems that you face problems of the
(48:37) psyche being in conflict with each other
(48:39) the problem of being caught up in
(48:42) illusion out of touch with reality and
(48:44) it presents the possibility of
(48:47) liberation and self transcendence and a
(48:50) fullness an enhanced meaning in life
(48:54) it's a myth of wisdom that is perennial
(49:00) II relevant because it's not about the
(49:03) past it's about what's happening in you
(49:05) right here right now
(49:13) I want you to notice a couple things
(49:15) about this I want you to notice first
(49:19) how reason and spirituality are not
(49:22) opposed to each other here there
(49:24) inseparably bound together I want you to
(49:30) notice how Plato is putting Socrates the
(49:34) Socratic project is Socrates is what how
(49:36) you you know get the man to teach the
(49:39) lion how you get to realize your own
(49:43) foolishness with Pythagoras because
(49:47) here's right the self transcendence the
(49:52) rising above yourself the radical
(49:57) transformation of your consciousness and
(49:59) cognition that Pythagoras talks so much
(50:01) about now this is such an entrancing and
(50:08) enriching and empowering myth a
(50:12) perennial parable that it's going to
(50:16) beat the constant refrain throughout the
(50:20) West people are going to be coming back
(50:23) to it again and again and again
(50:30) and I want to talk now more about the
(50:34) Pythagorean side of Plato just to bring
(50:36) out a few things so Plato talks about
(50:50) like he uses a term I dass and that gets
(50:55) translated into the word form and when
(50:58) people hear the word form their shape it
(51:01) also gets translated into the word idea
(51:03) when they hear idea they think of
(51:04) concept or an idea in your head that's
(51:07) not what Plato means the we need he's
(51:13) using that words it's much closer to our
(51:15) word like a paradigm II he's using a
(51:17) word to talk about the real patterns
(51:18) that we're discovering in reality now
(51:20) there's an interesting thing about these
(51:22) real patterns they're both the access
(51:31) the pathway we have to understanding
(51:33) something the pathway we have for
(51:36) getting at the reality of something
(51:37) because that's those are the real
(51:38) patterns but they're not just the
(51:41) affordance of our knowing the real
(51:43) patterns are also what makes something
(51:45) be what it is so
(52:02) this is work also from the psychology of
(52:06) concepts and how people understand
(52:07) things well you ask people what a bird
(52:12) is they'll say the following oh yeah
(52:15) well I know what a bird is right it has
(52:18) wings feathers a beak and it flies there
(52:25) you go that's a bird they give you
(52:27) what's called a feature list and then
(52:30) you think that and then you can get
(52:32) involved in a very long process which i
(52:34) think is largely been something of a
(52:35) mistake we'll come back to this no not
(52:38) code totally because it's important in
(52:39) science but of thinking that the way I
(52:41) understand something is by having a
(52:44) definition of it in terms of the correct
(52:47) features now there's a problem with this
(52:49) although people believe that this is how
(52:52) they know what a bird is they're
(52:55) mistaken in an important sense because I
(52:56) could satisfy this definition in the
(52:58) following way I could put a couple wings
(53:00) on this table a bunch of feathers a beak
(53:02) and then throw it all up in the air have
(53:05) wings because in flight do I have a bird
(53:09) no I don't I have a bloody mess
(53:12) because what's missing is something more
(53:16) important what's missing is the
(53:18) structural functional organization the
(53:21) way all those things hang together the
(53:24) way they're structured together so that
(53:27) the bird functions as a whole what's
(53:31) missing from this is the structural
(53:33) functional organization that makes the
(53:36) whole greater than the sum of its parts
(53:47) the Germans have a great word for this
(53:50) Gestalt in English we don't the Greeks
(53:54) have a good word for this is the word
(53:56) logos although a word that's being
(53:59) discussed a lot today I think it needs
(54:02) to be discussed a little bit more
(54:03) carefully now here's the thing I want
(54:08) you to realize member we talked about
(54:10) how you pick up on real patterns and a
(54:12) lot of those patterns you're not picking
(54:14) up an explicit sense you know what a
(54:17) bird is you have some sense of the logos
(54:21) of it but if I ask you what is that
(54:23) logos what is the structural functional
(54:25) organization and most of that most of
(54:27) what makes a bird a bird is found in
(54:29) that logos but if I ask you what is the
(54:31) locus of a bird how do these all
(54:33) structure together so they function as a
(54:36) whole in which the whole transcends
(54:39) simply an accumulation of it you can't
(54:41) tell me that's what the research shows
(54:45) in fact you can't tell me your grasp is
(54:48) intuitive so notice something very
(54:54) interesting here you often have an
(54:56) intuitive grasp of the logos of things
(55:00) and the logos is form what form doesn't
(55:03) mean shape form means something more
(55:04) like formula it means the structural
(55:06) functional organization and that form
(55:08) that logos is not only how the thing is
(55:11) right integrated together it's how your
(55:15) mind can be integrated with it
(55:18) member this logos this real pattern is
(55:22) not only how you know something but it's
(55:25) also the pattern that makes it be what
(55:27) it is so this is a very different idea
(55:32) of knowing you thought already in the
(55:37) myth of the cave but when I really know
(55:39) something I cut I come form to it I
(55:46) become like it in some important way I
(55:50) get in my mind the same real pattern
(55:54) that's in the thing because that real
(55:57) pattern is what allows me to come to
(56:00) know the thing
(56:01) and to enter into that reciprocal
(56:03) realization with it now this is going to
(56:07) be an important idea this is an idea
(56:11) that's going to be taken up by Plato's
(56:13) greatest disciple somebody we're going
(56:16) to talk about next time when we're
(56:19) together and that's Aristotle thank you
(56:22) very much for your time
(56:24) [Music]
(56:41) you
(56:43) you
