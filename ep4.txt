(00:00) [Music]
(00:04) you
(00:04) [Music]
(00:14) welcome again to awakening from the
(00:16) meaning crisis this is episode four so
(00:20) last time we discussed the axial
(00:22) revolution and in particular how it
(00:25) moved into ancient Israel we talked
(00:28) about the advent of the psycho
(00:30) technology of time as cosmic history as
(00:33) a narrative and which there is an open
(00:37) future and in which your actions the
(00:40) moral quality of your actions can
(00:41) determine that future in which you
(00:43) participate along with God in the
(00:46) creation of that future this brings with
(00:49) it the idea of progress moral progress
(00:51) the increase in justice and this is how
(00:54) we move from the less real world to the
(00:57) more real world for the ancient
(00:59) Israelites it's understood as a journey
(01:02) through time and space historically we
(01:05) talked about the kind of God that the
(01:07) God of the Bible is how he is in fact
(01:11) the god of this open future and
(01:14) particularly he intervenes moments as of
(01:18) moments of Kairos turning points where
(01:21) he tries to bring people back on course
(01:24) we talked about the sense of faith as
(01:27) the sense of being on course to being
(01:31) able to sense how history is flowing and
(01:33) unfolding how you are participating in
(01:35) that story how you are shaping it and
(01:39) being shaped by it in a tightly
(01:40) reciprocal manner and that sin is the
(01:43) deviation from that and what is needed
(01:46) is to wake us back up to bring us back
(01:48) on course and we talked about how the
(01:51) prophets represented that and they
(01:53) represent increasingly that vision that
(01:57) axial vision of the moral redemption of
(01:59) history we then turned to look at how
(02:04) the axial revolution was coming into
(02:06) ancient Greece and in particular two
(02:08) figures we looked at we're looking at
(02:10) the figures of Pythagoras and Socrates
(02:12) last time we talked about Pythagoras and
(02:14) how he represents an exaptation of that
(02:18) shamanic behavior of altering the state
(02:21) of consciousness entering into something
(02:23) like a soul flight but how for
(02:26) Pythagoras
(02:27) that had been allied with the psycho
(02:30) technology that was being emphasized in
(02:32) Greece rational argumentation the
(02:34) discovery of rational patterns in the
(02:36) world and Pythagoras of course is famous
(02:38) for discovering that music can be
(02:41) expressed mathematically he is at least
(02:43) associated his school with things like
(02:45) the Pythagorean theorem this idea that
(02:48) we can enhance our capacity to pick up
(02:51) on the real patterns in the world even
(02:54) if those are not readily apparent to us
(02:56) and by coming into a direct awareness of
(03:00) those patterns through our rational
(03:03) insight and faculties we can transform
(03:06) ourselves and Pythagoras changes the
(03:09) shamanic soul flight into a release a
(03:12) freedom from imprisonment in this world
(03:14) which he represented as being imprisoned
(03:17) in the body and we fly free and so soul
(03:20) flight has been turned into a radical
(03:22) kind of self transcendence in which we
(03:24) are liberating ourselves from the
(03:26) illusory world as we more and more
(03:28) conform to the rational patterns that
(03:31) dictate the structure of reality the
(03:36) other person who is going to figure and
(03:39) in fact is figures even more largely in
(03:41) the axial revolution in ancient Greece
(03:44) is the figure of Socrates Socrates and
(03:47) Pythagoras are going to be the two most
(03:48) important influences on Plato and if you
(03:52) were to put Western civilization on to
(03:54) two feet the one foot is the Bible the
(03:58) other foot is the works of Plato so
(04:03) Socrates is a very unusual figure there
(04:06) are as many interpretation of Socrates's
(04:08) as there are of people like the Jesus
(04:12) even in his time there were many
(04:15) differents Socratic movements groups of
(04:17) people who claim to be adherents and
(04:20) disciples of Socrates he is an enigmatic
(04:23) interesting provocative and maddeningly
(04:26) frustrating figure to try and get clear
(04:28) on so I want it understood that when I'm
(04:31) talking about Socrates I'm talking in
(04:32) about a particular interpretation that I
(04:35) share with other people I think it can
(04:37) be well argued for
(04:39) as I said whether or not this was the
(04:42) full historical Socrates it's very hard
(04:46) to know and in some sense this isn't
(04:49) that relevant because it's the Socrates
(04:50) I'm going to talk about that has become
(04:52) part of the cognitive and existential
(04:55) grammar of the West so getting into the
(05:01) figure of Socrates is kind of
(05:02) interesting a good way to start is to
(05:06) see how how provocative a person he was
(05:10) is to do his biography so as many of you
(05:16) probably know ancient Greece was a world
(05:21) in which people believed they could
(05:22) speak to the God through Oracle's the
(05:24) Oracles were human or or otherwise
(05:29) natural phenomena that represented how
(05:32) the gods were speaking to humanity one
(05:35) of the most important Oracle's is at
(05:36) Delphi and I've been to Delphi if you
(05:38) get a chance at some point in your life
(05:41) go to Delphi it will really put this app
(05:44) on your brain because the way the
(05:46) landscape is organized really does have
(05:49) a transformative impact on sort of your
(05:51) consciousness and your sense of self and
(05:53) your sense of place in the world
(05:54) so the situation that the Wright the
(05:59) site of Delphi is itself very
(06:01) transformative what would happen is a
(06:03) woman Pythia would sit in a cave or
(06:06) something similar to it again became
(06:08) always the caves like the association
(06:10) with shamanism
(06:11) remember that shamanism was associated
(06:13) with cave art ritual practices taking
(06:16) place in caves like in Pythagoras so
(06:19) she's in a cave she's sitting on a
(06:21) tripod there might be some intoxicating
(06:24) gases in there she's eating perhaps
(06:26) eucalyptus leaves she's probably going
(06:30) into some kind of psychedelic trance
(06:33) state that seems plausible and then what
(06:36) happens is people would because that's
(06:38) that's that is a cross-cultural thing we
(06:40) find that people are thought to have
(06:42) access to the gods by being able to
(06:43) enter into altered states of
(06:45) consciousness so what would happen is
(06:47) people would come in they would bring
(06:48) their questions they would pose
(06:50) questions to Pythia she would then
(06:52) speak on behalf of the gods and then
(06:56) after speaking on behalf of the gods the
(06:59) people around her would there would be
(07:02) males who would interpret what she had
(07:04) to say so the thing about being an
(07:10) Oracle is if you want to stay in
(07:11) business you don't want to give clear
(07:12) answers right so if I come to an Oracle
(07:18) and I ask a specific question I'd I
(07:20) don't want to give a specific answer I
(07:22) think there's a very good reason for
(07:23) that I don't think that people actually
(07:25) can foresee the future in any kind of
(07:27) supernatural manner so typically if you
(07:30) go to an Oracle and say should I marry
(07:32) Cassandra you'll get an answer or
(07:34) something like sometimes the spring
(07:36) comes early or should I invest in this
(07:41) project you'll get an answer like you
(07:45) know sometimes the squirrels do not
(07:48) gather too many nuts you don't know what
(07:51) to make of this and it might provoke an
(07:54) insight in you it might provoke a
(07:55) reflection in you and whether or not the
(07:59) events go one way or the other you can
(08:00) often retrospectively reinterpret them
(08:03) as having been consonant with the
(08:05) Delphic Oracle so the Oracle seems to be
(08:08) providing a foresight 'fl information
(08:10) but usually of course it's not so what
(08:16) happens is a bunch of Socrates's
(08:19) friends he's already famous when we sort
(08:22) of meet him in his biography a bunch of
(08:24) Socrates's friends decided to go to the
(08:27) Oracle and ask the Oracle a question
(08:29) about Socrates so they make the trick to
(08:32) Delphi and I in my mind I sort of
(08:35) picture this almost like half jokingly
(08:37) there they want to see what kind of
(08:38) crazy answer they're going to get from
(08:42) the Oracle about Socrates so they go all
(08:45) the way up to the Oracle and then they
(08:49) pose their question and the question
(08:54) they pose is there any one wiser than
(08:57) socrates and what they're looking for or
(09:02) perhaps not what they're looking for
(09:03) what they're expecting is some very
(09:06) dick obscure answer like you know the
(09:11) snow melts farther in the south or some
(09:14) bizarre answer and instead they get this
(09:18) answer no there's no human being wiser
(09:22) than socrates crystal-clear answer and
(09:28) so you can imagine how shocked they are
(09:34) so they travel back of course to relate
(09:37) this story to Socrates and here's here's
(09:42) something telling first of all that's
(09:43) just telling it enough itself that the
(09:45) Delphic Oracle would give such a clear
(09:47) answer now it's it's it's it's a
(09:50) qualified answer there's no human being
(09:53) wiser than socrates right but when they
(09:59) go back to Socrates Socrates is response
(10:02) is also profound interesting so if we're
(10:07) honest if we're honest and we found out
(10:11) from some sacred authority that we are
(10:14) very wise most of us would be very self
(10:16) congratulatory is like yeah I knew it
(10:19) and how do I know that because one of
(10:21) the most persistent biases have is that
(10:24) people believe they're above average
(10:26) intelligence and of course most people
(10:27) must be wrong about that because most
(10:30) people have well average intelligence
(10:32) but if you ask anybody is your
(10:33) intelligence average they will tell you
(10:35) know I have above-average intelligence
(10:37) more so of course even for ideas such as
(10:40) wisdom but Socrates isn't
(10:44) self-congratulatory he doesn't say yep I
(10:47) knew it all along
(10:48) there's the confirmation I so want now
(10:51) that's really telling enough itself
(10:52) because to quote a friend of mine Leo
(10:56) Ferrara we are entering the age of
(10:57) confirmation porn in which people are
(11:01) continuously seeking confirmation from
(11:05) their beliefs and and part of what's
(11:07) going on - the meaning crisis and the
(11:10) ever expansion of in our
(11:12) society is precisely because we have
(11:14) technologically enhanced through social
(11:16) media our capacity for gratifying
(11:20) our bias for conformation we'll talk
(11:24) about this later but we all carry a
(11:25) terrific bias called the confirmation
(11:27) bias in which we seek information that
(11:29) confirms our beliefs and we tend to
(11:31) avoid information that challenges it and
(11:34) part of what is going wrong right now in
(11:38) our culture is that through a lot of
(11:40) factors that are endemic to the meaning
(11:43) crisis we are accelerating and
(11:44) exacerbating our propensity for falling
(11:47) into the confirmation bias and I think
(11:49) that's what my friend Leo means by
(11:51) confirmation porn we have a kind of
(11:53) pornography if we take pornography to
(11:56) mean the gratuitous an unwarlike
(11:59) justified sanction
(12:01) satisfaction of a desire then we are
(12:04) living in an age of confirmation porn
(12:06) Socrates is a corrective to that here is
(12:10) a great temptation he has presented the
(12:14) word of the God that he is wise wiser
(12:17) than anyone else and rather than
(12:19) accepting it and giving in to that
(12:21) confirmation bias his immediate response
(12:23) is to challenge it now the challenge is
(12:27) tricky for Socrates Socrates is no
(12:30) atheist although he's going to be
(12:32) charged with atheism when he's put on
(12:33) trial but he does believe in the gods
(12:36) he's going to do something very
(12:38) important about the gods he's going to
(12:39) transform the Greek gods into moral
(12:42) exemplars but and what that means for
(12:46) Socrates is the gods can't lie the gods
(12:50) can't lied for Socrates and this is one
(12:53) of the ways he's going to transform the
(12:54) understanding of the gods and Plato
(12:56) along with him the Greek gods as they
(12:59) are represented in standard Greek myths
(13:00) aren't very accurate portrayal because
(13:02) those gods lie and they write they cheat
(13:05) and they betray Zeus cheats Zeus cheats
(13:08) on his his wife etc but for Socrates and
(13:11) this is part of the actual revolution
(13:13) the gods represent moral exemplars they
(13:15) represent ways in which we can self
(13:19) transcend and morally improve so for
(13:23) Socrates it's therefore axiomatic that
(13:27) the gods can't lie to him so the gods
(13:30) are telling the truth
(13:31) this wedding and this is something we're
(13:33) gonna come back to the way the Greeks
(13:34) Wed Definity divinity I should say to
(13:38) reality the truth and sacredness are
(13:41) bound up together is going to be really
(13:45) pivotal think about how much we separate
(13:47) those two in our culture but for
(13:50) Socrates they are interpenetrating so
(13:53) the gods can't lie they have to be
(13:57) disclosers of the truth but on this on
(14:00) the other hand Socrates has significant
(14:05) and profound self-knowledge one of the
(14:08) things I have tattooed on my back is
(14:10) know thyself it was inscribed at the
(14:12) Delphic Oracle but Socrates makes it his
(14:17) personal slogan for life there's been
(14:22) some recent things written about this
(14:23) and I think they've largely reflect
(14:25) reflected a misunderstanding of what
(14:27) know thyself mean know thyself doesn't
(14:29) mean become aware of your biography I
(14:33) mean we all are prey to that and we have
(14:35) a culture that exacerbates that
(14:37) narcissism we like to stroke the ego of
(14:40) our personal autobiography and store up
(14:42) treasure domin that we can point to
(14:44) other people that indicate our
(14:46) uniqueness and our specialness and why
(14:49) the universe should specially take care
(14:51) of and pay attention to us that's not
(14:54) what know thyself means it doesn't mean
(14:56) that kind of stroking of your
(14:59) autobiographical ego know thyself is
(15:02) much more a kind of direct participatory
(15:06) knowing it means understanding how you
(15:09) operate it's not it's if I were to use a
(15:13) literary analogy it's not like your
(15:16) autobiography it's more like your
(15:17) owner's manual it's how do you operate
(15:20) what are the principles what are the
(15:22) powers perils what are the constraints
(15:25) that are operating within you Socrates
(15:30) as we'll see thought that that kind of
(15:33) self-knowledge was central and the this
(15:35) is the core of the axial revolution the
(15:38) axial revolution is this critical
(15:40) awareness and sense of responsibility of
(15:43) zone cognition so on one hand the gods
(15:49) can't lie when they say Socrates as the
(15:53) wisest human being but on the other hand
(15:54) Socrates has deep self knowledge he has
(15:57) Socratic self-knowledge in which he is
(15:59) convinced that he is not wise and he is
(16:07) not willing to give up on either one of
(16:10) those and that's a telling thing about
(16:11) him that tells you something very
(16:13) central about him he holds these two
(16:14) together his existential self-knowledge
(16:18) and this disclosure from reality are
(16:22) going neither one of them is going to be
(16:24) given a greater Authority they're going
(16:26) to be held together so now Socrates
(16:29) faces a personal dilemma a dilemma that
(16:32) goes to the core of who and what he is
(16:34) how can it be that he is the wisest
(16:37) human being when he knows that he is not
(16:40) wise so this is a very deep dilemma that
(16:46) he set for himself it's a kind of
(16:48) profound problem that he seeks to solve
(16:50) and what that means is that Socrates
(16:53) starts on a quest he starts on a quest
(16:56) of trying to determine how both of those
(16:59) things could be the case at the same
(17:01) time now the quest seems to have evolved
(17:07) very naturally into a way in which he
(17:10) interacted with those around him what
(17:12) Socrates would do is he would go to
(17:15) people who claimed or would credited
(17:18) with being wise and he would ask them
(17:21) question he invented in fact what has
(17:23) become known as the Socratic method also
(17:26) known as of Linkous the Socratic method
(17:29) is a way of asking questions in order to
(17:31) try and draw somebody out we'll talk a
(17:36) little bit more about in Linkous in a
(17:38) minute but first I want to talk about
(17:40) the two types of people that we have
(17:43) good reason to believe Socrates was
(17:45) interacting and what that can tell us
(17:47) about the Socratic notion of wisdom and
(17:51) we're going to see how the Socratic
(17:53) notion of wisdom knowledge and this idea
(17:56) of self-knowledge
(17:57) is deeply bound up with how meaningful
(18:00) your life is so the two groups that
(18:05) Socrates the two groups of people that
(18:07) were accredited as being wise were the
(18:14) philosophers and the sophist if you
(18:18) remember last time we talked about
(18:20) pythagoras pythagoras actually invents
(18:23) the word philosophy it comes from two
(18:27) greek words by lia sophia this means
(18:35) right the the friendship love of wisdom
(18:38) so and Pythagoras creates a community
(18:42) around him you create a community
(18:44) distributed cognition in which you
(18:46) interact with other people in order to
(18:49) try and pursue wisdom a philosopher is
(18:52) someone who in concert with others is a
(18:55) lover of wisdom so Socrates is
(19:00) interacting with the philosophers and in
(19:03) particular one group of philosophers
(19:07) that come before him in fact Socrates is
(19:11) regarded as creating a revolution in
(19:13) philosophy precisely from how he
(19:15) differed from the natural philosophers
(19:21) and he is also doing the Socratic method
(19:25) with the sophist and you can see that
(19:27) this also comes from Sophia wisdom it's
(19:30) where we get our word sophisticated from
(19:32) the Sophists are also people who claim
(19:35) to be wise now the natural philosophers
(19:38) are very interesting the natural
(19:40) philosophers seem to represent a
(19:43) fundamental change in human cognition so
(19:46) I'm going to take as an example one of
(19:49) the natural philosophers who is
(19:51) considered to be the first example of it
(19:55) bailey's now because these guys are just
(20:00) as we're coming out of the dark age and
(20:02) they predate Socrates sometimes by a
(20:05) hundred a couple hundred years right or
(20:08) their boats a lot of what we have from
(20:11) them is
(20:11) very fragmentary we don't have very much
(20:14) in fact you can put most of Bailey's
(20:18) philosophy into three lines into three
(20:22) sentences I once taught this to a course
(20:24) of mine and one of my students went out
(20:25) and made a t-shirt in which they put all
(20:27) of the Lee's philosophy on one t-shirt
(20:29) because we that's how fragmentary it is
(20:31) let's talk about these three fragments
(20:33) because they reveal something very
(20:34) important one is all is the moist the
(20:41) next is the lodestone as sue K and this
(20:48) is important because this word sue K
(20:51) which we now pronounce psyche is going
(20:53) to be the basis of the idea of
(20:54) psychology as a discipline and finally
(20:57) everything is filled with God's which
(20:59) sounds very pre-action monic
(21:10) now what you have to pay attention to
(21:13) here is not what the LEAs is saying but
(21:16) what that what he says reveals about the
(21:19) kind of thinking he is creating what
(21:21) does he mean by this all is the moist of
(21:25) course there's controversy about all of
(21:27) this because it's fragmentary it's old
(21:28) but given how other people in the
(21:32) ancient world like Aristotle followed up
(21:33) on this a plausible interpretation is
(21:35) everything is made out of water
(21:37) everything is made out of water
(21:39) now that's false everything isn't made
(21:42) out of water
(21:43) it's not just scientifically fault its
(21:44) kind of metaphysically false everything
(21:46) can't be made out of water or we
(21:47) wouldn't be able to identify water on
(21:49) its own but put that aside think about
(21:53) this what surrounds ancient Greece water
(21:56) be digging into the ground what will you
(21:58) hit water what falls from the sky water
(22:02) what does everything need in order to
(22:03) live water
(22:04) what can take the shape of any container
(22:06) you put it in water see what I'm trying
(22:09) to get you to see is although Bailey's
(22:12) idea is false it's highly rational it's
(22:16) highly plausible what he's doing is
(22:19) using his reason and his observation to
(22:21) come up with a plausible explanation of
(22:24) what the underlying substance is behind
(22:28) everything by the way pay attention to
(22:31) this word this means stands under
(22:34) another metaphor it's related to lots of
(22:39) other words where we use standing to
(22:41) talk about understanding for example
(22:43) okay so notice what he's doing here he's
(22:49) not doing mythology he's not generating
(22:54) a narrative about some divine agent he's
(22:58) not saying this has happened because
(23:01) Zeus cheated on Hera and then Hera
(23:03) sought there's there is no story here
(23:05) there's no mythological narrative
(23:08) there's no right divine agents involved
(23:13) that's not how he's trying to explain or
(23:16) understand instead he's doing a rational
(23:20) analysis based on
(23:22) and he's trying to get at the underlying
(23:25) stuff that everything is made of do you
(23:27) see what I'm showing you what fail EES
(23:30) is inventing is there any other word for
(23:33) this he's inventing how to think
(23:35) scientifically how how this happens is
(23:40) obscure but that's what's happening he's
(23:44) inventing the kind of thinking that we
(23:47) now and I'm gonna say it again
(23:49) take it for granted as if it's natural
(23:52) but he's inventing it what does this
(23:58) mean the lodestone has su K so a
(24:01) lodestone is a natural form of magnet
(24:03) what's interesting about magnets is that
(24:05) they can move themselves and they can
(24:06) move other things around them
(24:08) the original meaning of this is of
(24:10) course breath or wind but what it
(24:12) ultimately refers to and came to refer
(24:14) to is write anything that's a living in
(24:18) the sense that it's self moving that it
(24:20) can move itself and that can therefore
(24:22) cause other things to move so I can move
(24:24) myself and therefore I can make other
(24:26) things move the magnet can move itself
(24:29) and it can make other things move I'm
(24:32) aware of sookay within me I see the
(24:35) magnet doing something similar and
(24:37) therefore I conclude the magnet and I
(24:40) both share Sookie he's wrong but that
(24:43) doesn't matter this is a plausible
(24:46) rational argument here he's trying to
(24:49) get at what we would now call the
(24:51) underlying force behind things now
(24:56) please remember that by the way that
(24:58) Sookie originally means your capacity
(25:01) for being able to move yourself and make
(25:03) other things move you may ask why does
(25:06) that become the word for mind psychology
(25:09) Minds ookay
(25:11) because the mind is that part of you
(25:13) which you can most move it is the most
(25:16) self moving part of you and it's where
(25:18) all of your capacity to move other
(25:21) things starts if I'm going to move this
(25:24) marker my mind first moves itself and
(25:27) that drives me to move the marker
(25:33) but that way of even thinking about me
(25:36) so that I can start a science of the
(25:38) psyche starts with Daly's and what
(25:43) what's this everything is filled with
(25:44) this seems so scientific John and then
(25:47) you're throwing this at me the gods
(25:49) isn't that a throwback to mythology I
(25:51) don't think so I don't think so
(25:54) see look what he's doing here now in
(25:58) turn I need to introduce a term I
(26:00) promise to try and keep the
(26:01) technicalities to a minimum what we need
(26:02) a term here right so ontology is the
(26:10) study of being the structure of reality
(26:14) ontological analysis
(26:23) it's when you use rap reasoning to try
(26:26) and get at the underlying structure of
(26:29) reality by getting at the underlying
(26:32) stuff and the underlying forces that are
(26:37) at work in it so theories is introducing
(26:41) the ontological analysis that drives the
(26:43) Scientific Revolution
(26:44) what are scientists doing they're trying
(26:46) to get at the underlying stuff they're
(26:47) still trying to do it right now they're
(26:50) trying to get at the underlying forces
(26:53) they're trying to see into the depths of
(26:55) reality they're engaging in ontological
(27:00) depth perception
(27:03) this doesn't mean right physical like
(27:08) this doesn't mean our normal perception
(27:10) into spatial depth what I'm seeing what
(27:13) I mean here is seeing with the mind into
(27:15) the depths of reality ontological depth
(27:18) recep perception now once you get that
(27:23) he's discovering this way he's
(27:27) discovering he's inventing this way of
(27:30) looking at the world it's gonna bleed
(27:34) into right here right now think about
(27:36) how powerful that way must be think of
(27:39) the power in that vision he gets an
(27:43) access to the depths of reality and what
(27:46) is he saying that provokes ah that
(27:51) provokes wonder that gives him a sense
(27:54) of connecting to what is most real it
(27:59) helps him to make the most sense of
(28:01) things and that's what it is to
(28:05) experience something as sacred so this
(28:12) is powerful stuff
(28:16) now Socrates was seems to have been
(28:21) influenced by particular one of these
(28:23) natural philosophers called an
(28:24) exaggerated who was in Athens just
(28:26) before Socrates annings a gross declared
(28:32) that the Sun wasn't to God for example
(28:33) that it was a hot rock and he got into a
(28:36) lot of trouble for things like this
(28:39) Socrates seems to have enjoyed more than
(28:46) enjoyed he seems to have been impressed
(28:48) by the natural philosophers commitment
(28:50) to getting at the truth but ultimately
(28:54) Socrates he rejects this not because he
(29:02) rejects reason rational analysis he's
(29:06) going to engage in that himself multiple
(29:08) times or argumentation his whole
(29:11) Socratic method as we'll see is all
(29:13) about argumentation what does he reject
(29:15) about the natural philosophers they
(29:19) don't help him with his axial project
(29:22) see the problem with the natural
(29:24) philosophers is they give you truth
(29:26) without transformation they give you
(29:29) facts they give you knowledge but they
(29:32) do not indicate how you become wise they
(29:36) do not indicate how you overcome
(29:38) self-deception they do not indicate as
(29:41) Socrates would say how to become a good
(29:43) person now it's interesting how much
(29:46) people say that even now even today
(29:49) sometimes in clear ways that are helpful
(29:52) sometimes in confused and mixed-up ways
(29:54) which are unhelpful but the idea that
(29:57) our scientific worldview while giving us
(30:00) all kinds of knowledge does not in any
(30:02) way train us for wisdom does not tell us
(30:05) how to become wise does not tell us how
(30:08) to transcend ourselves and become better
(30:10) people this is a common complaint and
(30:12) we'll come back to it about the
(30:14) scientific worldview Socrates sees it
(30:17) even then so here you have truth but no
(30:23) relevance
(30:26) the truths that are discovered are not
(30:28) existentially relevant they don't matter
(30:31) they don't enable the cultivation of
(30:35) wisdom the transformation and
(30:37) transcendence of the self now Sardi's
(30:47) interacting with the sophist which is
(30:49) famous is a lot more antagonistic this
(30:54) this when he talks about his relation
(30:57) here it's much more the language or the
(30:59) tone at least that's how I read it of
(31:01) disappointment he was expecting more and
(31:05) he found less here and it's not clear
(31:08) how much is the Socrates and how much
(31:10) this is Plato who's writing about
(31:11) Socrates but here the relationship is
(31:14) much more antagonist ik now who are the
(31:17) sophist well if you remember we talked
(31:19) about when the axial revolution is
(31:20) coming to Greece you get in the
(31:22) emergence of democracy and in Athens the
(31:27) democracy is direct democracy now before
(31:29) we get too far into this we don't want
(31:33) to over glamorize this yes
(31:35) Athens is the beginning of democracy but
(31:40) let's remember if I was a woman the last
(31:42) place I would want to do well in the
(31:44) ancient world as ancient Athens ancient
(31:46) Athens treats its women horribly just
(31:49) horribly Sparta treats its women better
(31:51) than Athens democracy is only for
(31:55) Athenian adult males women foreigners
(31:59) anybody else even if they're Greek
(32:01) they're not right considered to be
(32:05) worthy of participation in the
(32:07) democratic process and it's a direct
(32:09) democracy right everybody files into the
(32:13) assembly and votes on everything now
(32:18) what that means is as I've already
(32:21) mentioned your capacity for debate and
(32:23) argumentation is a root to power this is
(32:27) why it develops so powerfully in ancient
(32:30) Athens the better you are at arguing the
(32:33) better you are at persuading other
(32:34) people the more powerful and influential
(32:37) you will be
(32:40) what happens is a group of people invent
(32:45) a new psycho technology they invent
(32:51) rhetoric they invent ways of picking up
(32:57) on how language and cognition interact
(33:02) they find standardized skills that can
(33:06) be practiced and developed so that you
(33:08) can influence people increase the chance
(33:12) that your language will change their
(33:15) mind
(33:17) now the Sophists were only concerned
(33:22) with teaching the skills they basically
(33:25) separated the technology from any kind
(33:28) of moral commitment so for example a
(33:32) particular sophist might go in the
(33:34) morning to this aristocrat and help him
(33:38) argue for why Athens should increase the
(33:40) number of ships in its Navy and in the
(33:43) afternoon go to this aristocrat and help
(33:45) him craft an argument as to why often
(33:47) should decrease the number of ships in
(33:49) the Navy the sophist didn't care which
(33:53) was the case what mattered was
(33:55) empowering the individual to win the
(33:57) argument now how does this work and how
(34:01) can we relate it to our to our lives now
(34:04) so basically a good way to think about
(34:10) this is the sophist pick up on the fact
(34:13) that when we are communicating we're
(34:15) going to talk about this a lot later as
(34:17) we go on we are being driven by what we
(34:20) find salient and relevant not just what
(34:23) we find true or believed to be the case
(34:26) remember with the nine dart problem what
(34:29) stands out to us what's relevant shapes
(34:33) how we see things and how we understand
(34:36) them so let me give you a modern analog
(34:43) for what how rhetoric works a place
(34:45) where rhetoric is readily apparent
(34:48) advertising okay see the point about
(34:54) advertisement is to make use of the way
(34:57) your brain will associate things the way
(34:59) your brain finds certain things salient
(35:01) make things seem highly relevant to you
(35:03) in order to manipulate your behavior now
(35:07) what's telling about this and this is
(35:09) the point about the sophist is how much
(35:12) that can happen right in a way that is
(35:16) disconnected from whether or not it's
(35:18) true I mean you watch the beer
(35:22) commercial and here it is here's really
(35:25) attractive people and they all get
(35:28) together and they're all having a great
(35:30) time and it's this beer and here's the
(35:32) beautiful attractive people go into an
(35:34) actual bar that's not like that okay and
(35:39) you know you're not going to see the
(35:40) kind of broken-down lives drunk people
(35:45) now here's the thing you know that
(35:47) that's not true you know that you like
(35:49) if you like if you went into a bar and
(35:51) you actually saw something like that
(35:53) happening if when you wash your hair
(35:55) with shampoo you were suddenly in the
(35:57) shampoo commercial you'd worry about
(35:59) your sanity you know it's not true it
(36:02) doesn't matter it makes certain stimuli
(36:04) salient to you and so you buy the beer
(36:07) you buy the shampoo this is what I mean
(36:11) when I say your beliefs aren't the only
(36:13) thing driving you so this brings us to a
(36:18) notion I promise to come back to and I
(36:20) want to use it technically I'm not
(36:23) trying to be vulgar but this is
(36:24) important this is the notion of
(36:27) and the classic work is by Harry
(36:30) Frankfort on this his essay on
(36:33) it's 20 years old now his Frankfort is
(36:37) very interested in talking about the
(36:40) difference between somebody being a
(36:42) artist and somebody being a
(36:44) liar because they aren't the same they
(36:48) can overlap a person can be both a liar
(36:50) and a artist but let's talk
(36:52) about pure cases how does the liar work
(36:56) the liar depends on your commitment to
(36:58) the truth the lawyer tells you something
(37:01) I'll use P to represent some proposition
(37:04) the liar says P to you even though not P
(37:07) is the case because if he can get
(37:09) convinced you that P is the case you
(37:11) will change your behavior because your
(37:13) behavior is to some degree significant
(37:16) degree influenced by your commitment to
(37:18) the truth if you believe P is true that
(37:20) will change your behavior that's how
(37:22) lying works lying depends on the fact
(37:24) that in general people are committed to
(37:26) the truth because in general people want
(37:28) to be in touch with reality
(37:29) that's not how works see
(37:33) unlike lying works by making
(37:37) you disk disinterested unconcerned with
(37:41) whether or not what with what is being
(37:42) said is true when somebody's
(37:47) bullshitting you they're trying to get
(37:50) you to not find important or right
(37:53) central how true the claim is instead
(37:57) they're working in terms of the rhetoric
(37:59) they're trying to capture you in terms
(38:01) of how catchy it is like the advertiser
(38:04) how salient it is how much it grabs your
(38:06) attention so there was a famous example
(38:12) from this from the Simpsons and you know
(38:14) Simpsons has been aunt for a thousand
(38:16) years now and I think it's still on so
(38:18) this is from a long time ago and at the
(38:20) time it seemed so almost absurdly
(38:23) ridiculous funny but it turned out to be
(38:26) extremely extremely prescient because
(38:29) the example is a political example there
(38:31) are two aliens running for political
(38:33) office and they're giving a speech to
(38:37) Americans right and I mean no insult to
(38:41) Americans but I mean I think we're aware
(38:45) of how what I'm going to say is relevant
(38:48) to American politics right now and the
(38:49) speech goes something like this one of
(38:52) the aliens named Kang says my fellow
(38:54) Americans when I was young I dreamt of
(38:57) being a baseball but now we must move
(39:01) forward not backwards upwards twirling
(39:05) twirling towards freedom and everybody
(39:07) Cheers
(39:07) no it's meaningless it doesn't mean
(39:09) anything but he invokes youth baseball
(39:15) moving forward moving upward twirling
(39:18) and freedom and so if you're an American
(39:20) you get this rush you get this rush that
(39:25) rush is these are all salient things
(39:28) they're highly relevant to you you
(39:30) associate and identify with them and so
(39:33) you're swept up you're caught up in it
(39:35) now why does matter well part
(39:40) as I said at the beginning part of the
(39:42) way people articulate the meaning crisis
(39:45) is there's so much and it seems
(39:47) to be increasing we are separating
(39:49) relevance and salience from truth but
(39:56) there's a deeper reason and I think this
(39:58) is part of why it matters to Socrates
(40:00) look you can't although we use this
(40:03) metaphor for self-deception it's
(40:05) actually not a good metaphor you can't
(40:07) lie to yourself it makes no sense
(40:11) cognitive psychologists have been
(40:13) pointing that in philosophers and
(40:14) pointing this out you can't no not Pete
(40:18) and then say to yourself but P but P the
(40:21) trouble is you know that this is not the
(40:25) case and so simply stating this to
(40:27) yourself
(40:28) doesn't do anything you can't lie to
(40:30) yourself because you're in possession of
(40:33) the truth
(40:35) did I just prove to you that
(40:36) self-deception is impossible no not at
(40:38) all see you can't lie to yourself but
(40:41) here's what I would argue you can
(40:43) yourself why because lying has
(40:48) to do with believing I'm gonna come back
(40:50) to this again and again look believing
(40:54) isn't something you directly do here
(40:59) I'll show you pick a belief you would
(41:02) like to have I would like to have the
(41:04) belief that everybody loves me I don't
(41:07) believe that but I would like to truly
(41:09) have that belief so what should I do
(41:12) I should just believe believe you see
(41:16) televangelists doing this telling people
(41:19) believe but you can't you can hope that
(41:23) everybody loves you you can wish that
(41:26) everybody loves you but if I say believe
(41:28) it
(41:29) you can't do it that somehow belief
(41:31) works it's not a voluntary action you
(41:35) can't lie to yourself see self-deception
(41:40) works in a different way you know what
(41:41) you can do you can yourself how
(41:44) can you yourself because what
(41:45) you can do is direct your attention if I
(41:49) say pay attention to this finger you can
(41:51) and you can also choose to pay attention
(41:54) to something now attention and we'll
(41:56) talk about this later
(41:57) and it's how central it is there's two
(41:59) sides to attention you can direct your
(42:03) attention for example if I say your left
(42:06) big toe you're paying attention to it
(42:08) and suddenly it's salient to you when
(42:10) you pay attention to something it makes
(42:13) it more salient it stands out for you
(42:15) but you know what else attention can
(42:19) also be direct not only be directed by
(42:22) you to make things more salient your
(42:24) attention can be caught a sudden noise
(42:27) and you turn and you attend to it it was
(42:30) salient and it captures your attention
(42:32) so not only can you direct your
(42:34) attention your attention can be captured
(42:37) by what you find salient and notice what
(42:41) this means you can do you can direct
(42:44) your attention to something and make it
(42:46) more salient and because it's more
(42:48) salient it will tend to capture your
(42:52) attention and because you're paying
(42:53) attention to it you make it more salient
(42:55) which means it will more likely capture
(42:56) your attention do you see what's
(42:58) happening here these two things feed on
(43:00) each other I pay more attention to it it
(43:05) becomes more salient it becomes more
(43:06) salient it gathers my attention I pay
(43:08) more attention to it
(43:09) I'm more likely to be attracted to it
(43:11) and it spins on itself in a
(43:13) self-organizing manner until your
(43:17) attention is attached to something it's
(43:20) super salient to you it's highly
(43:22) relevant to you and you lose the
(43:25) capacity to notice other things that's
(43:29) how you yourself the salience
(43:32) and the catchiness of the stimulus has
(43:35) overtaken any concern you have for
(43:38) whether or not it's true
(43:40) or represents reality this is how you
(43:42) deceive yourself so do you see that's
(43:48) why Socrates is going to be so
(43:49) antagonistic towards the sophist they
(43:57) are the opposite the opposite of the
(44:02) axial revolution they are the opposite
(44:05) of that rational self-knowledge the
(44:09) attempt to overcome self-deception the
(44:10) sophist are promoting and when
(44:14) you promote you not only
(44:15) promote the deception of others you make
(44:17) yourself more vulnerable to
(44:19) self-deception you fall more and more
(44:22) prey to self-deception so the natural
(44:30) philosophers are truth without relevance
(44:34) the sophist and the propensity for the
(44:39) promotion of represent
(44:42) relevance disconnected from truth so
(44:47) notice here they have the power to
(44:49) transform people but they've
(44:53) disconnected it from the pursuit of the
(44:55) truth these people can give us knowledge
(44:58) of the facts but do not facilitate self
(45:02) transformation what Socrates wanted is
(45:06) he wanted both he wanted individuals who
(45:15) knew how to pay attention in such a way
(45:18) that what they found salient helped them
(45:20) determine the truth and that the truth
(45:22) that they found help them to train their
(45:25) attention to find salience Socrates
(45:28) wanted something like that so what do
(45:34) you would do is he would go about
(45:35) questioning people maddening frustration
(45:39) so Socrates would come up to somebody
(45:42) and say well what are you doing here and
(45:45) oh I'm in the marketplace well why are
(45:47) you in the marketplace well I'm
(45:49) purchasing something well why are you
(45:51) purchasing something well I want to get
(45:52) these goods
(45:53) why do you want these goods because
(45:56) they'll make me happy and nad then
(45:58) Socrates starts to oh so you must know
(46:00) what happiness is well happiness is
(46:04) pleasure Socrates I guess and these
(46:06) things give me pleasure but is it
(46:07) possible Socrates with us to have
(46:09) pleasure and still find yourself in a
(46:12) horrible situation that you really
(46:13) dislike well of course
(46:15) Socrates that's possible oh so then
(46:18) happiness isn't pleasure you're being
(46:21) coy with me tell me tell me Socrates
(46:23) would say what is happiness oh it's you
(46:26) know it's getting what's most important
(46:29) to you well that means that you have to
(46:31) have knowledge is it any kind of
(46:33) knowledge well no it's the knowledge of
(46:35) what it what's important what's truly
(46:37) important or what you only think is
(46:39) important I guess what's truly important
(46:41) Socrates
(46:42) okay so what's that knowledge of what's
(46:44) truly important called
(46:45) I guess that would be wisdom Socrates oh
(46:48) so in order to be happiness to find
(46:50) happiness you must have first cultivated
(46:52) wisdom tell me how you cultivate wisdom
(46:54) and what wisdom is and the person goes
(46:57) our they collapse they get to this point
(47:01) where they can't answer they fall into a
(47:06) state called aporia people compared it
(47:13) to being stung by a stingray or falling
(47:16) under a magician spell you don't know
(47:18) what's going on now here's what now you
(47:23) one went one thing you might say well
(47:25) Socrates is just a skeptic he's trying
(47:26) to show people that they don't know
(47:27) anything because he wants to show that
(47:30) the gods are right that nobody has any
(47:32) wisdom etc that's too simple I think
(47:34) something more sophisticated is going on
(47:36) with Socrates Socrates right Socrates is
(47:40) trying to get you to realize he's like
(47:43) he's like in coronating the axial
(47:46) revolution he's trying to get you to
(47:47) realize how much how much each one of us
(47:50) myself included how much were
(47:51) bullshitting ourselves all the time why
(47:54) because we pursue things we find things
(47:58) salient to us their happiness Fame its
(48:03) salient to us and we're pursuing it
(48:05) we're putting our efforts into it
(48:07) way before we understand it way before
(48:10) we grasp the truths of it we are always
(48:13) making ourselves susceptible to
(48:16) because we are being driven by powerful
(48:18) motivations that are salient to us that
(48:21) are greatly in excess of our
(48:24) understanding of their truth or reality
(48:26) we're always all of us bullshitting
(48:29) ourselves and the point and what that
(48:34) does is that provokes a reaction in
(48:36) people it goes one of two ways people
(48:39) either go ah and they don't want to be
(48:41) showing that about themselves and they
(48:43) become angry at Socrates or some people
(48:49) have an insight they realize oh oh I
(48:54) need to transform myself I need to find
(48:58) a way to keep relevance and truth
(49:01) tracking each other
(49:02) enabling each other and when Socrates
(49:07) realized that he was having this effect
(49:08) on people he had his answer to his
(49:11) dilemma
(49:12) he knew how it was that the gods were
(49:14) not lying and he was the wisest of human
(49:18) beings his answer was the following he
(49:22) knew what he did not know and we all say
(49:27) I know what I don't know I made note of
(49:29) a lot of it no no no he knew in a way
(49:32) that allows you to directly painfully
(49:35) confront your capacity for in
(49:37) yourself
(49:40) to really realize what you do not know
(49:42) is to realize I am pursuing her and I
(49:45) don't know what's going on I'm pursuing
(49:48) that and I don't know what's going on
(49:52) that's what he's talking about
(49:58) now many people think that Socrates dis
(50:01) concluded that that's it he didn't know
(50:03) anything no that's not what Socrates is
(50:05) talking about Socrates does claim to
(50:07) know things you can imagine how Socrates
(50:11) pisses people off so he is put on trial
(50:16) in ancient Athens there isn't a state
(50:19) that arrests you one one citizen accuses
(50:21) another you brought on trial you're put
(50:22) in front of fifty five hundred men it's
(50:24) always men remember very very very
(50:27) chauvinistic society and then the
(50:31) accuser presents their case the
(50:34) defendant presents their case and then
(50:35) they the jury votes on it so Socrates
(50:39) was accused by people that he pissed off
(50:41) of atheism which doesn't mean not
(50:44) believing in God's it just means
(50:45) teaching strange gods because as I
(50:47) mentioned he was concerned to make the
(50:50) gods moral exemplars now when Socrates
(50:55) is on trial it becomes clear that they
(50:59) will let him go if he sort of agrees to
(51:01) stop doing this philosophy stuff that
(51:03) he's doing stops pissing people off and
(51:04) then he utters something that's very
(51:06) famous and this is a statement of him
(51:10) deeply knowing something he says the
(51:12) unexamined life is not worth living a
(51:15) life in which there is no effort made to
(51:18) put these two together is a life that is
(51:21) not worth living because it is a life to
(51:23) use our terms that is awash in
(51:26) that is beset by self-deception and
(51:29) self-destructive behavior so Socrates
(51:31) knows what makes a life meaningful
(51:35) there's a kind of wisdom wisdom is to
(51:38) keep your truth Machinery and your
(51:40) relevance machinery tightly coupled
(51:42) together so that you don't
(51:45) yourselves see
(51:49) Socrates famously claimed to know taw
(51:52) erotica we're gonna have to talk about
(51:55) this later because it comes from erotic
(51:59) and for most of us all you hear when you
(52:01) hear erotic is sexual that's not what
(52:04) eros means right it's more much more
(52:07) broader term in ancient Greece what
(52:08) Socrates means is he knows how to love
(52:10) well and that doesn't mean romantic love
(52:15) but it means as Socrates knows what to
(52:18) care about he knows how to keep what he
(52:23) cares about with what's real he would do
(52:27) things like walk into the marketplace
(52:29) and say look at all the things I don't
(52:30) need he'd say how much time did you
(52:34) spend on fixing your hair this morning
(52:36) Oh about 20 minutes how much on fixing
(52:39) yourself
(52:45) Socrates knew what to find significant
(52:47) what to find important he knew how to
(52:49) properly care he also compared himself
(52:52) to a midwife he knew how to take that
(52:55) caring and that sense of what makes life
(52:58) meaningful the cultivation of wisdom and
(53:00) help people draw out give birth to their
(53:03) better self that's why he compared
(53:05) himself to a midwife this is what he
(53:07) knew socrates knew how reason and love
(53:16) go together you might find it sort of
(53:20) entertaining to know that Frankfurt who
(53:22) I mentioned a few minutes ago wrote a
(53:24) book called reasons for love what he
(53:26) also puts together reason and love
(53:29) things that we have been taught to keep
(53:32) as antithetical to each other
(53:34) for Socrates separating them which our
(53:38) culture regularly and reliably does is
(53:40) one of our greatest follies
(53:42) they need to be interdependent and
(53:45) intertwined with each other we need to
(53:46) rationally know what we should most care
(53:49) about
(53:53) so Socrates just put on trial he's found
(53:57) guilty he just narrowly loses
(54:05) so then after losing and it looks like
(54:11) part of the reasons were political and
(54:13) part of them he's pissed off the
(54:14) powerful and all kinds of things he
(54:17) associated with people that turned out
(54:19) to be corrupt but he loses by very
(54:24) narrow margin and then what happens is
(54:26) each side proposes a penalty the accuser
(54:29) has proposed death that Socrates should
(54:31) be killed and then this tells you
(54:35) something about Socrates Socrates says
(54:36) the following practicing philosophy has
(54:40) cost me I have to constantly work at it
(54:43) it's very demanding I'm not right
(54:45) wealthy I am dependent on other people
(54:48) people attack me it's been very risky
(54:52) the worst penalty could be for me to
(54:54) continue doing philosophy and in order
(54:56) to make that even worse the government
(54:58) should give me free housing and free
(55:00) food for the rest of my life so as you
(55:03) can imagine this pisses everybody off
(55:06) and Socrates is found in a much greater
(55:10) vote he's condemned to death now notice
(55:12) Socrates is so convinced that he has the
(55:16) right kind of know thyself not
(55:18) autobiographical but this that I've been
(55:20) talking about he knows how he works and
(55:24) how to train it to transform it so that
(55:27) he cares well and reduces his capacity
(55:30) for self-deception that he's willing to
(55:33) die for it he finds that meaning so
(55:35) important that he's willing to die for
(55:38) it now he's a very interesting figure
(55:40) for that reason but there's also other
(55:43) important things we should know about
(55:44) Socrates this the shamanic is still in
(55:47) Socrates because he could do the
(55:49) following he could stand in one place
(55:51) for 24 or even 48 hours meditating on
(55:55) his own thoughts
(55:57) he was terrifically capable of
(55:59) controlling his body's physiological
(56:01) reactions he could drink a lot without
(56:05) getting drunk he could
(56:07) into battle in winter without any right
(56:09) shoes on his feet he was famously brave
(56:14) so he and he had this divine voice
(56:19) whenever he was about to do something
(56:21) wrong
(56:22) he'd hear this voice that would tell him
(56:24) don't do it Socrates so once again you
(56:28) still find right the shamanic has been
(56:32) carried into the socratic in really
(56:34) important ways we're going to talk about
(56:36) later how those two are interwoven
(56:39) together now Socrates has many followers
(56:45) but there's one person who was present
(56:49) at the trial but wasn't present at his
(56:51) death when he drinks the hemlock and you
(56:54) know what I got to sit in the spot in
(56:56) Athens that corresponds to where
(56:59) Socrates was probably imprisoned at
(57:01) least that's what they said that person
(57:07) who was present at the trial then even
(57:10) offers to pay for Socrates his release
(57:13) but is ill and not present at his death
(57:16) his Plato and Plato as I foreshadowed is
(57:20) going to take Pythagoras and Socrates
(57:24) and put them together and advance even
(57:28) more significantly the axial revolution
(57:30) in ancient Greece thank you very much
(57:33) for your time
(57:34) [Music]
(57:53) you
