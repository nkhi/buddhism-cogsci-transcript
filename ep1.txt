(00:00) you
(00:00) [Music]
(00:12) welcome this is a series in which I am
(00:16) going to endeavor to put together pretty
(00:20) much all of my work my name is John burr
(00:23) of a key I am an assistant professor at
(00:26) the University of Toronto I'm in the
(00:28) psychology department and in the
(00:30) cognitive science program and I also
(00:32) teach for the Buddhism psychology and
(00:34) mental health program I've produced a
(00:36) lot of videos on a lot of various topics
(00:38) some of you have perhaps seen them but
(00:41) what I want to do now in this series is
(00:43) draw it all together and present to you
(00:45) a overall unified argument and that can
(00:49) show you the interconnections between
(00:51) pieces that you might have seen before
(00:54) now how all this got started is I got
(00:59) very interested in a particular
(01:00) phenomenon I got interested in the fact
(01:02) that there seemed to be a growing
(01:03) confluence between people who are
(01:07) interested in Buddhism and people who
(01:09) are interested in cognitive science I'll
(01:11) talk a little bit later as we go on what
(01:13) cognitive science is but you know some
(01:17) of this already in the world at large
(01:19) because we're going through what's
(01:21) called the mindfulness revolution
(01:22) mindfulness is being spoken of
(01:24) everywhere I was in a bookstore
(01:25) yesterday chapters and there's a whole
(01:28) section just on mindfulness itself so
(01:31) why is the mindfulness revolution
(01:33) occurring well it's occurring
(01:33) particularly because of this
(01:35) intersection between Buddhism and
(01:37) cognitive science but why is this
(01:39) happening and why is it you know so
(01:42) explosive in nature and what do we mean
(01:45) by mindfulness some of the work I've
(01:47) done is trying to get clear about that
(01:49) we're going to talk about that in this
(01:51) in this series now there is also a lot
(01:55) of other things that in my mind seem to
(01:59) be convergent with this growing
(02:02) confluence between Buddhism and
(02:04) cognitive science there is an increasing
(02:06) interest both academically and in the
(02:09) public at large and the topic of wisdom
(02:11) something that people did not talk about
(02:13) very much not that long ago well the
(02:16) wisdom is now a very hot topic within
(02:18) psychology and cognitive
(02:20) and books offering to train you in
(02:23) wisdom are again becoming popular same
(02:26) bookstore experience yesterday I bought
(02:29) my son a book called how to be a stoic
(02:32) this is a this is like how is it that a
(02:36) philosophical position from the
(02:37) Hellenistic era has become a popular
(02:40) book that people are seeking why is
(02:43) there this hunger for wisdom and why are
(02:47) people meeting it with these kinds of
(02:51) things
(02:51) the stoicism the philosophies of the
(02:54) Hellenistic period we're gonna talk
(02:56) about that I think there's good reason
(02:57) for that
(02:59) of course there's increasing academic
(03:01) and public interest in psychedelics I
(03:04) just gave a talk earlier this week
(03:09) Yale about psychedelics and the
(03:13) increasing interest in psychedelics and
(03:15) psychedelic experiences you're seeing
(03:17) radical things with them people can be
(03:19) released from treatment-resistant
(03:21) addiction they can overcome
(03:24) post-traumatic stress disorder like the
(03:26) normal with the best therapy right
(03:31) solution rate for people with
(03:33) post-traumatic stress disorders about
(03:35) right you know things go really well 20%
(03:38) or so you introduce psychedelics into
(03:41) the therapy and you can get the right
(03:43) the healing rate up to 80 percent so
(03:47) what's going on there why is there this
(03:49) interest there's increasing public
(03:55) interest which is matched by a huge
(03:59) academic in in the topics of happiness
(04:02) now we've always been a happiness
(04:05) oriented culture life liberty and the
(04:07) pursuit of happiness and so forth right
(04:09) but it's taken a particularly
(04:12) interesting turn the topic of meaning
(04:14) and meaning in life is coming to the
(04:16) fore people in more and more are talking
(04:19) about not just sort of sheer
(04:20) contentedness but what it is for a human
(04:23) life to be meaningful and it turns out
(04:26) that meaning in life is terrifically
(04:29) important it's very predictive of
(04:31) well-being
(04:32) it's very predict
(04:33) of how well you are doing in your life
(04:36) in general so it is no wonder that our
(04:38) people are seeking it out now my my
(04:41) contention and what I'm gonna argue is
(04:43) it's no coincidence that all of these
(04:45) things are happening right now it's no
(04:47) coincidence this confluence between
(04:49) Buddhism the mindfulness revolution the
(04:52) interest in wisdom and ancient
(04:54) philosophies like stoicism the
(04:57) increasing public interest in
(04:58) psychedelics and transformative
(04:59) experiences and mystical experiences
(05:01) right
(05:03) the increasing academic and public
(05:05) interest in meaning in life there's all
(05:08) a reason for there's there's a unifying
(05:11) account for why this is happening but
(05:14) there's another set of things this is
(05:17) sort of the light side of what I'm
(05:18) talking about there's a there's a
(05:20) there's a set of dark factors that seem
(05:22) to be converging as well right we have
(05:26) what seems to be although they're you
(05:29) know people have disputing it but I
(05:30) think the evidence is becoming clearer
(05:32) and clearer the CDC just released some
(05:34) data recently we're going through amount
(05:36) mental health crisis suicide is spiking
(05:40) and it's right now there are some
(05:43) socio-economic factors but there's
(05:46) clearly other things that are at work
(05:49) right there's increasing sense many
(05:53) people are expressing it of losing touch
(05:55) with reality we encounter more and more
(05:58) often in individuals and groups nihilism
(06:01) expressions of cynicism expressions of
(06:05) deep kinds of frustration and futility
(06:08) you have the abandonment of trust in any
(06:12) of our public institutions we're losing
(06:16) right we've completely lost any sort of
(06:18) faith or trust in a political system
(06:20) we're losing faith in our judicial
(06:22) system right religious affiliation is
(06:27) declining consistently throughout
(06:28) people's participation in right clubs
(06:32) organization is in decline
(06:38) in general and my co-authors on the book
(06:43) on zombies in Western culture the 20s
(06:46) for century crisis Christmas Pietro and
(06:49) Philip Mis eviction we argued right that
(06:53) the this sense of being out of touch has
(06:56) gone on with an increasing sense and
(06:58) we'll talk about this because I'm going
(07:00) to use this term technically we're going
(07:01) to talk about this and Frankfurt's use
(07:03) of it there's an increasing sense of
(07:05) more and more
(07:07) everywhere pervading any of you take a
(07:12) look at the book we actually chart how
(07:14) this has been spiking and it's
(07:16) concordant with all kinds of other
(07:18) increases in these dark factors people
(07:23) are getting the sense that we're
(07:24) spending and you can see this already in
(07:26) the public media but it's it's also
(07:29) within the academic world that we're
(07:31) spending too much time in our virtual
(07:32) environments there seems to be
(07:35) increasing evidence for example of right
(07:39) a connection between various social
(07:42) media increased depression increased
(07:44) loneliness and then more in general and
(07:51) we'll talk about how this shows up a
(07:53) little bit more implicitly it shows up
(07:54) in the entertainment we seek and the
(07:56) mythologies we like like they're zombies
(07:58) we're gonna talk about that
(08:00) why are zombies so big right why are
(08:03) superheroes so big right now right
(08:06) there's an increase this these
(08:10) mythological and we'll taco what myth
(08:12) means these mythological forms I'm gonna
(08:15) argue our expressions of a cultural
(08:18) sense a sense that we're stuck somehow
(08:20) one way you can note that is just by
(08:22) noting how pervasive almost to the point
(08:27) of being a constant factor in our
(08:30) background is people talking about
(08:31) crisis and collapse apocalypse the
(08:35) zombie apocalypse the imminent collapse
(08:38) of civilization all of these things are
(08:41) now pervasive they're taken for granted
(08:43) at one point right the you know movies
(08:48) demonstrating this had to be sort of
(08:49) science fiction they were considered
(08:51) radical right
(08:52) now this is becoming a pervasive
(08:55) background sense now I think all of
(08:59) these negative factors also have a
(09:01) unifying explanation in fact what I'm
(09:04) going to argue throughout the course of
(09:07) this series is that the positive factors
(09:10) and the negative factors all point to a
(09:16) unified explanation this is going to be
(09:22) an idea that our culture is experiencing
(09:29) a profound meaning crisis a crisis in
(09:31) meaning and we're gonna have to talk
(09:33) about what does that meaning mean now
(09:38) I'm not claiming that this is the only
(09:39) crisis we're facing far from it what I
(09:41) want to do in fact is talk about how the
(09:43) meaning crisis is interacting with other
(09:44) crises the environmental crisis -
(09:48) socio-economic crisis but in addition to
(09:51) those which are quite well discussed and
(09:54) the public at large there is a meaning
(09:59) crisis which is being discussed quite
(10:01) significantly with that academia but
(10:03) needs to be brought to the public at
(10:04) large
(10:05) because one of the things I'm going to
(10:06) argue is that these three crises are not
(10:08) interesting not independent from each
(10:10) other they're interdependent in
(10:11) important ways but what is this meaning
(10:17) that's coming to crisis why do we hunger
(10:21) for it how do we cultivate the wisdom
(10:26) that's what I'm gonna argue wisdom is
(10:28) ultimately about to generate enhance
(10:31) this meaning wisdom is about realizing
(10:33) in both senses of the word becoming
(10:36) aware and making real it's about wisdom
(10:39) is about realizing meaning in life in a
(10:42) profound way how do we cultivate this
(10:46) wisdom what does it mean and I'm not
(10:48) going to talk about that just
(10:49) practically I'm gonna talk of so I mean
(10:51) not just theoretically I'm gonna talk
(10:52) about that practically as well what are
(10:54) some practices that people can engage in
(10:57) and are engaging in to try and address
(10:59) this need for the cultivation of wisdom
(11:03) what role for example
(11:05) do mindfulness practices play within the
(11:08) cultivation of wisdom so here's the
(11:16) three questions that are we're gonna
(11:17) keep coming back to again and again and
(11:19) again what is this meaning why do we
(11:23) hunger for it and how do we cultivate
(11:26) the wisdom to realize it so some of the
(11:31) topics of course we're going to be
(11:32) addressing are centrally the meaning
(11:35) crisis how did this kind of meaning
(11:40) evolve what like what is it why is it so
(11:42) important to the evolution of our
(11:45) humanity
(11:46) then more specifically the history of
(11:49) the meaning crisis why did it arise what
(11:52) are the historical factors by doing that
(11:55) we'll get in a historical accounted
(11:57) meaning we'll get a sense of what this
(11:58) meaning is that has come into crisis
(12:00) that people individually feel they are
(12:03) lacking or losing in their lives we want
(12:09) to talk about connections between
(12:10) meaning wisdom and importantly self
(12:13) transcendence it's going to turn out
(12:15) that this notion of self transcendence
(12:17) again which will have to develop and
(12:18) explicate be something that's a core
(12:21) need because it performs core functions
(12:23) for human beings and to bound up with
(12:25) these ideas of wisdom and of course
(12:29) meaning and along the way in fact right
(12:32) from the beginning we're going to start
(12:34) to see that there's deep connections
(12:35) between meaning wisdom self
(12:37) transcendence and altered states of
(12:40) consciousness why do human beings seek
(12:44) to alter their consciousness in fact not
(12:47) just human beings are there intelligent
(12:48) organisms seek to do this right
(12:51) Caledonian crows will tumble down rubes
(12:54) in order to make themselves dizzy for no
(12:56) other purpose than to alter their state
(12:58) of consciousness what is going on why
(13:01) does intelligence need to be conjoined
(13:05) to an altered state of consciousness and
(13:07) why in particular have human beings
(13:08) developed very sophisticated processes
(13:12) for generating harnessing and
(13:14) interpreting these altered states of
(13:16) consciousness
(13:17) we're gonna talk about that in
(13:19) connection with shamanism and ritual
(13:23) we're gonna talk about that in
(13:25) connection to the flow state this is
(13:26) when you're in the zone and why people
(13:29) seek it and why it's so powerful we're
(13:32) gonna talk about it as I mentioned in
(13:34) connection with psychedelic experiences
(13:36) more importantly the mystical
(13:38) experiences that can occur within some
(13:41) psychedelic experience because it turns
(13:43) out it's the mystical experience that is
(13:45) more important and transformative but
(13:47) there's a subset of those mystical
(13:49) experiences that are very crucial these
(13:52) are awakening experiences these are
(13:55) experiences in which people come back
(13:57) from the mystical experience and say
(14:00) that was somehow more real than this and
(14:04) I need to change my world I need to
(14:07) change myself they engage in what la
(14:11) Paul has called a transformative
(14:12) experience what is also known as quantum
(14:15) change a radical transformation of their
(14:18) lives and we note we've got good
(14:20) research now showing that they're right
(14:24) their lives get better after these
(14:27) awakening experiences I'm going to talk
(14:32) about that in depth and dare I say it
(14:35) maybe we can bring all of this together
(14:37) and actually propose and and maybe some
(14:42) people will be affronted by this but
(14:44) propose a scientific a cognitive
(14:47) scientific account of what enlightenment
(14:49) is and why it alleviates the suffering
(14:53) from lack of meaning that is
(14:55) particularly pertinent for us today but
(14:58) has always been a perennial threat since
(15:03) the axial revolution now that means of
(15:08) course we're going to have to also talk
(15:10) about topics that have connection with
(15:12) the darker aspects as I said of
(15:16) meaning-making
(15:16) what's the connection because they're
(15:18) deep and profound between this meaning
(15:22) making that is so central and our
(15:24) endemic capacity for self-deception for
(15:29) soft
(15:30) struction there's a reason why we are so
(15:34) a wash in because is a
(15:37) perennial threat to us self-deception is
(15:41) endemic that means it'll be important to
(15:46) talk about foolishness as something
(15:49) different from ignorance ignorance is a
(15:52) lack of knowledge foolishness is a lack
(15:55) of wisdom foolishness is when your
(15:57) capacity to engage your agency pursue
(16:02) your goals is undermined and threatened
(16:06) by the self-deception and the
(16:09) self-destructive behavior that is like a
(16:13) perennial vulnerability to your
(16:15) cognition but what I'm gonna argue is
(16:17) the very same machinery that makes you
(16:19) so adaptively intelligent it's the same
(16:22) machinery that makes you susceptible to
(16:25) foolishness that will take us into some
(16:28) of the topics that are relevant to
(16:32) people's existential experience meaning
(16:34) crisis topics like absurdity alienation
(16:38) futility horror real horror most horror
(16:45) movies aren't horror we'll talk about
(16:47) what horror really is and what people
(16:49) experience when they're actually
(16:51) experiencing horror their sense of grip
(16:53) on reality
(16:54) is being undermined and people find that
(16:59) as you can imagine terrifying we're
(17:05) gonna talk about meaninglessness and why
(17:09) and why more people experience this
(17:12) state the state of despair and once we
(17:19) do that right as we're moving into these
(17:24) kinds of topics we will be moving
(17:26) gradually from the historical account of
(17:29) the origin of the meaning crisis will
(17:32) give us some sense from the history of
(17:36) what this meaning is but we'll be moving
(17:38) into the cognitive scientific study
(17:42) cognition the client recalled in a
(17:44) scientific investigation of meaning and
(17:46) meaning making look when people use this
(17:50) word meaning it's a metaphor they mean
(17:55) there's something in their life that is
(17:59) analogous to how a sentence has meaning
(18:03) the pieces fit together in some way they
(18:08) make an impact on your cognition and
(18:10) connect you to the world in some way
(18:17) there's something about our lives that
(18:19) is analogous to the way sentences have
(18:24) meaning we have to unpack that metaphor
(18:26) what why is the metaphor used and what
(18:28) does the metaphor point to when we talk
(18:31) about the meaning of our lives how is it
(18:35) in fact it's some of the most meaningful
(18:36) experiences people have are precisely
(18:39) ones that are completely ineffable to
(18:41) them that they can't put into words
(18:43) what's going on we're gonna have to talk
(18:45) about different kinds of knowing some of
(18:48) them that have fallen off our cultural
(18:51) radar precisely because of the meaning
(18:53) crisis we tend to have reduced all of
(18:57) the ways that the ancients talked about
(18:59) how we know to one thing to know is to
(19:04) have a special kind of belief and so we
(19:10) are very belief centric which is why we
(19:12) are so focused as a culture on
(19:13) ideologies but it turns out that we're
(19:16) gonna have to have a much more expanded
(19:18) notion of what knowing means there is
(19:21) much more to knowing that having
(19:24) justified true beliefs there's the kind
(19:27) of knowing that's involved in knowing
(19:28) how to catch a baseball there's the kind
(19:33) of knowing of what it is like to be
(19:37) having this experience right now there's
(19:40) the kind of knowing that is knowing what
(19:45) it's like to be in something you're
(19:48) participating in like a relationship
(19:53) we have to talk about all of that now of
(19:58) course some of you might be aware of
(20:00) those other kinds of knowing because you
(20:01) know how integral and important they are
(20:03) to therapy which is another thing that
(20:07) is booming in our culture part of why
(20:09) it's booming is the meeting crisis part
(20:11) of what's booming is because people seek
(20:13) out therapy precisely because they're
(20:14) trying to recover these lost kinds of
(20:17) knowing the kinds of insight that is
(20:22) needed the kind of transformation not of
(20:24) your beliefs but of how you see things
(20:27) your sense of self and your sense of
(20:31) realness
(20:32) have to be transformed often in therapy
(20:35) that is why the psychedelics are so
(20:38) important for therapeutic success
(20:42) because they transfer they transform
(20:43) these other kinds of knowing we're going
(20:48) to talk about all of that this will give
(20:50) us this will give us a structural
(20:54) functional account of meaning what is
(20:56) the structure of it what are its
(20:58) cognitive processes what are its
(20:59) cognitive mechanisms how do they
(21:02) function how can they fall into
(21:08) dysfunction we're going to have this
(21:11) historical account and this structural
(21:13) functional account and were going to
(21:14) make them talk to each other they're
(21:18) going to inform and constrain and enable
(21:21) each other and from that dialogue what I
(21:27) propose audacious as it might sound is a
(21:31) real response to the meeting crisis an
(21:36) awakening from the meaning crisis that's
(21:39) what this series is about awakening from
(21:43) the meaning crisis not in some
(21:45) ideological fashion but in a profound
(21:48) transformative and existential manner so
(21:53) this is not something that I can do
(21:55) simply because this is not a problem
(21:58) for which there are simplistic answers
(22:00) if anybody offers you an answer to this
(22:02) crisis in an hour
(22:05) I would wager that they are deceiving
(22:09) you manipulating or they are on
(22:11) themselves significantly self-deceived
(22:14) there's a reason why we're stuck there's
(22:16) a reason why this is hard this is a
(22:18) complex and difficult thing we are
(22:20) undertaking so this series is going to
(22:24) be several videos long because I'm going
(22:29) to carefully and I hope responsibly
(22:31) build an argument to try and show how we
(22:35) can awaken from the meaning crisis how
(22:39) that meaning crisis interacts with the
(22:41) mental health crisis how it interacts
(22:42) with the environmental crisis how it
(22:44) interacts with the socio-economic crisis
(22:50) now this is my commitment to you I will
(22:55) always do my best to offer rigorous
(22:59) rational argumentation I will try my
(23:03) best to give proper scholastic credit to
(23:07) other people please understand that I'm
(23:11) aware that I'm not and nobody should be
(23:14) claiming to offer you the absolute
(23:17) uncontested truth I'm gonna offer you
(23:19) good arguments and good evidence but I
(23:24) don't want this to be an academic series
(23:27) I do my academic work and I'm proud of
(23:29) it but this I want this to be for people
(23:33) who are coming to this precisely because
(23:36) of a genuine personal existential
(23:40) interest so I will try to keep jargon
(23:45) and technicalities to a minimum I will
(23:48) have to introduce terms to you and I
(23:51) hope to explain them carefully along the
(23:54) way so my commitment to you is to I I
(24:02) can't be unbiased that's that's not a
(24:06) thing what I will try my best to do is
(24:09) to present to you my arguments my
(24:12) viewpoints and why I think they can be
(24:17) understood to be highly plausible
(24:20) so I want to start with how and why is
(24:29) this meaning so so so much a part of our
(24:34) humanity why is its own in to our
(24:37) humanity so much and I think the thing
(24:43) that we wanted we want to understand is
(24:47) I have to start somewhere right and that
(24:53) can be misleading because I think and
(24:55) one of my my co-authors Philip missive
(24:57) itch he this is something that he's good
(24:59) concerned with right I think this is a
(25:01) continuum question I think the deep
(25:03) connections between meaning making and
(25:04) cognition go deeply back into our
(25:07) evolutionary heritage way before our
(25:10) humanity but that's right so the fact
(25:14) that I'm starting somewhere is not meant
(25:16) to indicate that this is the absolute
(25:18) starting point what I want to do is
(25:20) point to a time when many people think
(25:23) our humanity the kind of people we are
(25:26) now came into form not fully like the
(25:32) way it is now because of course there's
(25:34) been lots of historical and cultural
(25:36) processes but the kind of humanity that
(25:39) we would recognize as us and how much
(25:43) this was bound up with meaning making in
(25:46) the way that I've been talking about so
(25:48) this period is known as the Upper
(25:50) Paleolithic transition it occurs around
(25:56) 40,000 BCE
(26:00) now with interesting about this is that
(26:03) biologically as a species we had existed
(26:06) much longer than this we existed about
(26:09) you know it's a there's some controversy
(26:12) around this but conservatively since
(26:15) about 200,000 BCE but around again
(26:21) roughly 40,000 BCE there's a change a
(26:26) radical change now again picking a
(26:31) Pacific time
(26:33) look like there's this there's nothing
(26:34) before there are no precursors some
(26:37) people have presented the upper
(26:38) paleolithic transition that way I'm not
(26:40) doing that I think that's a mistake
(26:42) there's a continuum you can see it back
(26:44) but at some point there's this radical
(26:47) change the upper paleolithic transition
(26:50) you see things human beings doing things
(26:52) they're not doing before they're making
(26:55) art they're making representational art
(26:58) they're making sculpture they're making
(27:02) cave paintings we have good evidence
(27:04) they start making music what else are
(27:09) they doing well we have some pretty good
(27:15) evidence all right that there's
(27:18) significant enhancement in their
(27:20) cognition how do we know this well we
(27:26) have the first use of calendars
(27:29) obviously not with numbers and dates
(27:32) because numeracy hasn't been invented
(27:33) but you have the symbolic representation
(27:36) of the phases of the Moon and the
(27:38) passage of days and so human beings are
(27:41) keeping track of time across very
(27:44) abstract patterns so that they can
(27:46) enhance their hunting abilities
(27:50) something else is happening which again
(27:54) it's so intrinsic to our humanity we
(27:57) right we're developing projectile
(28:01) weapons we're developing projectile
(28:04) weapons so the Neanderthals who are
(28:07) contemporaneous with Homo sapiens at
(28:10) this time don't have projectile weapons
(28:13) their spears are thick shafted heavy
(28:16) stone they're thrusting tools we know
(28:19) that they were getting in close to their
(28:22) quarry because they have bone damage
(28:25) that's similar to the kind of bone
(28:27) damage we see in human beings who are
(28:28) involved in cowboy rodeos where you're
(28:32) messing around with large angry mammals
(28:35) the Homo sapiens do something different
(28:38) they start to develop very thin Spears
(28:42) not with stone tips but with bone tip
(28:45) and bone is much harder to
(28:46) use the point about these is right there
(28:50) very good is projectile weapons they're
(28:52) very light and human beings develop the
(28:55) spear thrower and sling and they start
(28:57) to develop the ability to carry multiple
(28:59) missiles and project them at a long
(29:02) distance now that requires right
(29:07) increased development of your frontal
(29:09) lobe area which is going to turn out to
(29:14) be of course very important as we'll see
(29:16) for enhancing your intelligence think
(29:20) about how deep this is in your cognition
(29:21) this idea of like throwing right right
(29:26) think about how you talk about how you
(29:28) have a project that you're working on
(29:30) right project it's from your throwing or
(29:36) people will talk about oh they're over
(29:38) there there's an object that means
(29:40) thrown against or I'm the subject that
(29:46) means thrown under all day long
(29:49) cognitively you're throwing that's
(29:52) because this throwing task is such a
(29:56) complex task I mean we take it so
(29:58) trivial that you know there's a moving
(30:00) target and I throw something I can hit
(30:02) it but if you try and build artificial
(30:04) intelligence to do that as the military
(30:06) is discovered that turns out to be a
(30:07) really really hard problem so there's
(30:10) the projectile weapons are developing
(30:11) the kolender --ax the music the
(30:14) sculpture the paintings all right what's
(30:18) going on why is all of this stuff
(30:19) exploding now notice how all of this is
(30:24) associated with different aspects of
(30:26) what we mean by meaning obviously
(30:29) there's art and there's music that's
(30:31) somehow meaningful but there's also time
(30:35) as being made more meaningful it's being
(30:37) measured and understood and calendars
(30:39) and even time and space are now more
(30:41) meaningful because they're being used
(30:43) right in this highly dynamic way in
(30:46) projectile weaponry so what's going on
(30:54) why did it occur
(30:58) well there's a lot of good work done by
(31:02) this David Lewis Williams mattress a
(31:05) nose work in his book super natural
(31:07) selection I think is superlative his
(31:10) articles like did meditating make us
(31:12) human I got the pleasure of meeting Matt
(31:16) and he argues for what's going on at
(31:20) this time is a radical change in human
(31:24) cognition that's in line with the work
(31:27) of other people like Michael Winckelmann
(31:29) we know that before the upper
(31:32) paleolithic transition about 30,000 up
(31:38) to 60,000 or 70,000 times of what this
(31:42) might be happening we know that we went
(31:44) through a near extinction event human
(31:47) beings almost went extinct we were
(31:50) crunched down they think maybe to
(31:53) maximum of 10,000 individuals we'd
(31:56) almost died off part of it seems to been
(32:00) the overall climactic change of the end
(32:02) of the last ice age in Africa part of it
(32:06) there's a supervolcano that goes off
(32:08) around 70,000 years ago
(32:09) not sure but what happens is there's
(32:11) tremendous pressure put on human beings
(32:14) they move to the coasts in general to
(32:17) try and survive but human beings seem to
(32:22) have adopted a interesting response to
(32:25) this now first of all they diversify
(32:28) their diet and blah blah blah blah
(32:29) that's all important we'll talk about
(32:31) that but what's really interesting is
(32:34) that if the they don't come up so much
(32:37) with a technological response because
(32:40) climates too huge and on to poorly
(32:43) understood they come up with a social
(32:45) cognitive response what human beings do
(32:48) is they start creating broader trading
(32:50) networks you see because when you do
(32:54) that you're not as subject to individual
(33:00) environmental variation you have much
(33:02) more resources both in terms of what
(33:04) people can have what kind of discoveries
(33:07) they're making
(33:10) and so what happens is people start
(33:13) forming these much broader trading
(33:17) relationships now that's very
(33:19) significant because it opens up the
(33:21) scale at which human cognition has to
(33:24) operate in an important way and human
(33:28) beings plausibly responded by developing
(33:31) things that we see now is pervasive they
(33:33) developed a bunch of rituals and we're
(33:35) going to talk a lot about why ritual and
(33:37) so important for dealing with both the
(33:43) environmental challenge and the enhanced
(33:47) social network that they were creating
(33:50) to deal with it by the way we're going
(33:52) to talk about that a lot in this series
(33:53) how your cognition is very much
(33:55) participatory you participate in
(33:57) distributed cognition large networks of
(34:01) cognition meaning way before the
(34:03) internet networked computers together
(34:05) culture networked brains together in
(34:09) order to provide some of our most
(34:10) powerful problem-solving abilities so
(34:15) what are the rituals ok so you need
(34:18) various trading rituals because the the
(34:21) thing you're doing now and again think
(34:24) about how this you take this for granted
(34:27) and living in a city it is the deep
(34:29) presupposition of civilization you hang
(34:32) around with strangers lots of them and
(34:36) that's just like oh yeah well it's not
(34:39) oh yeah that's a hard thing other
(34:42) species don't do that so what's
(34:47) happening is we're getting this shift
(34:49) we're having to interact with people
(34:51) that are not in our kinship group in our
(34:55) hunter-gatherer group and we have to
(34:58) form relationships with them so we start
(35:02) to develop rituals too that have the
(35:06) function of enhancing our ability to
(35:08) come into communication and
(35:10) relationships of trust for individuals
(35:12) that we do not personally know you say
(35:17) ok that's why you still do stuff that
(35:20) makes no sense
(35:22) you meet somebody like you do that you
(35:24) stick out your hand and they grab it and
(35:25) then they move it up and down right this
(35:29) is the show you have no weapons
(35:31) this is allow the person to touch you to
(35:33) see if your hands are clammy or not
(35:34) there's all kinds of intuitive stuff
(35:36) going on I can feel how tense you are
(35:38) most of us don't pay attention to this
(35:40) stuff anymore but it's there when you
(35:44) shake hands when you ask how are you now
(35:48) again that has become trivial so we
(35:50) don't want an answer how are you we
(35:52) don't somebody starts answering you oh
(35:54) no but originally that reflects
(35:57) something because think about what
(36:00) important skill has to be enhanced for
(36:05) these rituals I have to be able to take
(36:08) your perspective I have to know what's
(36:11) going on in your mind I have to know how
(36:14) you feel I have to be able to move from
(36:17) a first person perspective to a third
(36:20) person perspective really really well
(36:22) because if I can't do that I'm not gonna
(36:25) be able to trade with you now that
(36:28) ability to take enhance perspective on
(36:31) others especially people that you don't
(36:34) know really means you have to develop
(36:37) ability Daniel Siegel calls mind sight
(36:39) the ability to pick up on other people's
(36:42) mental states and here's the thing as
(36:44) you start to increase your ability to
(36:46) pick up on other people's mental states
(36:47) you increase your ability to pick up on
(36:50) your own mental states and that of
(36:54) course is going to be part of the origin
(36:55) of things like metacognition and
(36:57) mindfulness now the next type of ritual
(37:02) you need it goes in the other direction
(37:05) the trade rituals is how I deal with
(37:07) strangers the problem is now when I'm
(37:09) starting to interact with all these
(37:10) people right my commitment and loyalty
(37:13) to my group is now more in question than
(37:16) it used to be in the past it could be
(37:18) taken for granted because you just were
(37:19) with these people
(37:20) and they were with you all the time but
(37:21) now if you allow me the word there's
(37:25) temptation from the stranger which of
(37:27) course is now part of all of our myths
(37:29) the way the stranger can come in and
(37:32) tempt us
(37:34) all right and so what do we do well we
(37:37) we create initiation rituals rituals
(37:41) that are designed to show right our
(37:44) commitment to the group and those
(37:48) rituals often require risk threat
(37:52) sacrifice now our rituals our initiation
(37:56) rituals have been very tamed down right
(38:00) but if you look back back in time these
(38:04) initiation rituals are often very
(38:06) traumatic dramatic people are put into
(38:09) situations in which they they might
(38:12) experience tremendous pain or fear we'll
(38:15) talk about some of these as we go
(38:16) through this series so why like why make
(38:20) somebody go through pain and fear
(38:22) because if they go through pain and fear
(38:25) that shows that they're really committed
(38:27) to you they're really committed to your
(38:29) group but what does that mean
(38:34) cognitively what does it mean for what
(38:36) how the mind gets trained you have to
(38:38) really improve your ability to regulate
(38:40) your emotion you have to really improve
(38:44) your ability to do what's called
(38:48) decentering
(38:48) to let yourself right be in the hands of
(38:52) other people a non egocentric
(38:56) perspective because what's important now
(38:59) is not it's not centered on you the
(39:01) ritual centered on you but you through
(39:04) the ritual are being centered on the
(39:05) group so this is having again tremendous
(39:10) impact on your cognition
(39:18) now there's a third kind of ritual that
(39:21) starts to emerge and it seems to have
(39:25) picked up on these cognitive
(39:31) enhancements that the trade rituals and
(39:33) the initiation rituals bring so I need
(39:35) to introduce an idea to you that's going
(39:36) to become pervasive this is the notion
(39:40) of exaptation exaptation now originally
(39:50) this is an idea from biology but the
(39:53) work of Michael Anderson has brought it
(39:55) directly into understanding how the
(39:58) brain operates how cognition operates
(40:01) acceptation in biological terms is an
(40:04) evolutionary mechanism so for example
(40:08) I'm using my tongue now to speak okay
(40:11) tongues did not evolve for speech if
(40:14) they did all the animals that had
(40:17) tongues would be speaking at you and
(40:19) that'd be terrifying especially your cat
(40:22) your cat talks to you I'm sure that
(40:24) would be terrifying so what did tongues
(40:28) evolved for they evolved to move food
(40:31) around in your mouth they're very
(40:32) flexible and they're poison detectors so
(40:36) they have all these does your last
(40:38) defense right for poison yeah right
(40:41) so they have all of these nerve endings
(40:42) so you have this highly sensitive highly
(40:44) flexible muscle now just because of the
(40:47) way we evolved this muscle is also in
(40:51) the air passageway because evolution is
(40:54) not an intelligent designer you use the
(40:57) same tube for breathing and for food
(40:58) very bad design but nevertheless that's
(41:01) how it is so your tongue it can
(41:02) interrupt your airflow flexible
(41:05) sensitive muscle that can interrupt air
(41:07) flow that's what I need for speech so
(41:09) the tongue was exempted evolution didn't
(41:11) have to make a speaking machine from
(41:14) scratch it took something that evolved
(41:17) for one purpose and was able to exact it
(41:19) and use it for another so what Michael
(41:24) and Anderson and others are arguing is
(41:26) very often this is what the brain does
(41:28) the brain will develop
(41:30) and ISM a little machine a set of
(41:33) cognitive processes for doing one thing
(41:35) and then it will use how to learn how to
(41:37) reuse that for something totally
(41:39) different we're going to talk about that
(41:41) repeatedly through this series so what
(41:44) happens is that these enhance mental
(41:48) abilities that are coming out of the
(41:49) trading and initiation rich will seem to
(41:51) be taken up into another set of rituals
(41:54) exempted into that seemed to be also
(41:57) pervasive these are shamanic rituals
(42:01) these are shamanic rituals we know that
(42:07) the ability to become aware of the mind
(42:10) right to control the mind to control
(42:14) your emotions or being trained as I said
(42:16) we know that human beings just because
(42:19) and we'll see more about this later
(42:21) just because they're highly intelligent
(42:23) creatures with sophisticated
(42:25) consciousness seek out altered states of
(42:28) consciousness in shamanism what you have
(42:32) is you have a cultivated practice for
(42:36) altering your state of consciousness
(42:39) that taps into an X this enhanced mine
(42:42) site this enhanced ability to manipulate
(42:45) and control your mental state in your
(42:47) emotional state now Michael Wingull
(42:51) men's work shows that pervasive through
(42:53) hunter-gatherer groups are right
(42:56) shamanic individuals in fact the shaman
(43:00) is such a pervasive historical figure
(43:04) that I think you can make a good case
(43:07) that it has become an archetypal figure
(43:10) something like you know the wise old man
(43:14) so Yoda and Merlin these are all
(43:18) shamanic figures what we know about
(43:23) shamanism is that they're the best
(43:25) health care you're going to have for a
(43:26) long time right and we'll talk about how
(43:30) and why that's the case we know that if
(43:33) you got a shaman in your group it's
(43:34) going to help to reduce right discord
(43:37) within your group it's going to enhance
(43:39) your hunting abilities of your group now
(43:43) I I'm a scientist I don't believe
(43:44) any supernatural abilities or spirits or
(43:47) things like that so I seek an alternate
(43:50) and mattress a no and Michael
(43:52) Winckelmann I seek an alternative
(43:53) explanation of why are shamans so
(43:56) effective what is going on and what I
(44:00) want to talk about is how central
(44:02) shamanism was to the Upper Paleolithic
(44:06) transition because a plausible case can
(44:10) be made that it's the advent of
(44:11) shamanism that helps to explain how
(44:13) human beings are capable of this sudden
(44:16) explosion in their cognition this of
(44:20) course the thesis is the thesis of
(44:21) several people as I mentioned Michael
(44:23) Winckelmann did Lewis Williams and
(44:26) others mattress I know because here's
(44:29) the issue
(44:31) right it's not a hardware changed the
(44:35) brain has already existed for a hundred
(44:38) and sixty thousand years it's not
(44:39) changing significantly during the Upper
(44:41) Paleolithic transition it's much more
(44:45) likely that it's not a hardware change
(44:49) in the brain it's a software change in
(44:50) how human beings are using the brain and
(44:54) what part of what I want to argue is
(44:55) that shamanism is probably playing a
(44:57) significant role and that software
(45:00) changed so now I need to introduce yet
(45:03) one more other term and again this is
(45:05) going to be important this is the idea
(45:08) of a psycho technology
(45:17) okay so technology means the systematic
(45:20) use of a tool which is a tool right here
(45:22) right the first thing to understand and
(45:28) this is Andy Clarke's phrase you're a
(45:30) natural born cyborg your brain has
(45:32) evolved across several species to use
(45:35) tools in fact when you start using a
(45:38) tool even for a very short period of
(45:40) time your brain will start to model it
(45:42) as part of your body that is why you can
(45:45) do weird things like when you're parking
(45:47) your car you can feel where the edge of
(45:49) your car is and all that sort of stuff
(45:50) you're a natural-born cyborg you have
(45:54) evolved to be integrated with machines
(45:57) look at me I'm a cyborg look at this
(46:00) around me the only thing that's natural
(46:04) here biologically is naked me everything
(46:08) else is a tool everything else is these
(46:11) are tools
(46:12) I wasn't born with clothing I used this
(46:16) in order to modify my ability to move
(46:18) through environments and carry stuff
(46:20) around this is a tool this is a tool
(46:22) this is a tool this is a tool these are
(46:27) tools now what's interesting is that can
(46:36) be accepted your brain's ability to
(46:38) attach to a tool can move off of a
(46:40) physical thing onto a cognitive thing so
(46:47) a physical tool fits your biology C fits
(46:53) your biology and enhances it right I can
(46:56) leave permanent marks that I can't
(46:58) otherwise do biologically on this board
(47:00) I have a bottle it fits my hand and I
(47:03) can carry liquids around if I had to
(47:05) carry it like that's the amount of
(47:06) liquid I can carry is minimal it fits
(47:10) your biology and enhances it a psycho
(47:11) technology fits your brain and enhances
(47:16) how it operates and you say what are you
(47:18) talking about what's this psycho tech
(47:19) now look here's one right here
(47:22) it's called literacy you're not born
(47:27) literate you're born linguistic
(47:30) you're born learning how to talk right
(47:34) Noam Chomsky all that sort of thing but
(47:36) you're not born literate in fact for
(47:38) most of our history we were completely
(47:40) illiterate
(47:42) what does literacy do for you
(47:45) it's a standard set of tools that
(47:48) standardize how you process information
(47:51) notice is how it enhances your cognition
(47:54) I don't have to hold all these terms in
(47:58) my mind I can leave them there on the
(48:00) board I can write stuff down and come
(48:06) back to it later so notice what I can do
(48:08) I can take my brain now and link it to
(48:11) my brain back then and my brain in the
(48:13) future so those are I'm networking all
(48:16) these instances together I'm improving
(48:18) my cognition I can also network my brain
(48:21) with your brain and improve my ability
(48:26) to solve probably think of if I were to
(48:28) do this to you I'm gonna take literacy
(48:30) out of your brain right now and you
(48:32) can't and I mean literacy in your head
(48:34) too you can't imagine words you can't
(48:39) put stuff on paper you can't reflect on
(48:41) your own cognition I take that out of
(48:43) you your brain is the same hardware but
(48:48) then the problems you can solve collapse
(48:51) down dramatically
(48:52) that's what psycho technologies do they
(48:55) do they enhance the software of your
(49:01) mission of your cognitive machinery now
(49:04) shamanism is a set of psycho
(49:07) technologies for altering your state of
(49:10) consciousness and enhancing your
(49:12) cognition so what does
(49:19) what does shamanism look like what are
(49:21) the kinds of things you do when write
(49:25) you're a shaman there are many people of
(49:30) course claimed to be practicing
(49:32) shamanism today and that's another thing
(49:34) why this rise in neo shamanism what are
(49:37) people thinking they're trying to get
(49:39) from it okay so the shaman does a lot of
(49:50) interesting things in order to get into
(49:53) a particular state so the shaman will
(50:00) often engage in things like sleep
(50:02) deprivation intense long periods hours
(50:08) of singing dancing chanting the shaman
(50:14) will often engage in imitation put on
(50:19) the clothing mask that represents some
(50:22) other figures some other animal right
(50:28) sometime the shaman will go into periods
(50:30) of isolation social isolation go out
(50:33) into the wilderness and of course
(50:40) although it's not necessary but it has
(50:43) been pervasive shamans will make use of
(50:44) psychedelics in order to help bring
(50:48) about an altered state of consciousness
(50:53) so so
(50:56) what's going on here Steve Taylor in his
(51:01) book waking from sleep talks about these
(51:03) disruptive strategies that people even
(51:05) today use in order to try and bring
(51:07) about what I called awakening
(51:09) experiences these radical
(51:11) transformations in people's sense of
(51:14) self and reality we're going to talk
(51:19) about that but one of the main ideas
(51:25) here is what a shaman is typically doing
(51:28) is trying to disrupt the normal ways in
(51:33) which you're finding patterns in the
(51:35) world why would you want to disrupt the
(51:39) normal way you find patterns in the
(51:41) world because the way you find patterns
(51:44) and member I said this the very thing
(51:46) that makes you adaptive also makes you
(51:48) subject to self-deception the way you
(51:52) find patterns right is very profound
(51:56) so this is something I study as a
(52:00) scientist right many of you may have
(52:03) seen this all right so this is called
(52:07) the nine dot problem you have to join
(52:10) all nine dots with four straight lines
(52:13) you have to start the next line from the
(52:16) terminus of the previous line then what
(52:17) people see this they initially say well
(52:19) this is very easy of course I can do
(52:21) this
(52:22) right one two three four oh wait I
(52:26) missed the middle dot okay one two three
(52:29) wait one two wait one two and then they
(52:33) pause this actually turns out to be a
(52:36) very difficult problem for people to
(52:37) solve joining all nine dots with four
(52:40) straight lines but why is it hard one
(52:42) line two lines three lines four lines
(52:47) what was hard about that and when you do
(52:50) that of course people get angry at you
(52:52) they say you cheated you went outside
(52:54) the box you went outside the square
(52:57) that's where think outside the box comes
(52:59) from now why that was hard is because
(53:04) you projected a pattern here
(53:07) the square and then you engaged
(53:12) unconsciously unconsciously your skills
(53:17) of connecting the dots when you were a
(53:18) kid you connected the dots and when you
(53:21) connect the dots you're not supposed to
(53:22) do this make a non dot turn you do that
(53:26) you won't get a picture of a picnic
(53:27) table you'll get like an acid trip
(53:29) psychedelic thing right so unconsciously
(53:35) you project a pattern and then you
(53:38) activate the appropriate skills and then
(53:41) you're locked and you're blocked you
(53:44) can't solve that problem not because of
(53:45) anything there in the data but because
(53:48) of the way you have framed it you have
(53:50) to disrupt your framing we're gonna talk
(53:53) a lot about that in order to get an
(53:55) insight in order to get an insight now
(53:58) let me tell you something again to start
(54:01) to introduce this to you saying to
(54:04) people think outside the box and this is
(54:07) kind of funny if you think about it
(54:08) saying to people think outside the box
(54:10) does not help them with this problem
(54:13) giving them the belief that they have to
(54:16) go outside the box does not help them to
(54:20) solve this problem that's what I meant
(54:23) when I said you shouldn't reduce all of
(54:25) your sense of knowing to believing
(54:30) what's involved here is not believing
(54:33) that you have to go outside the box it's
(54:36) knowing how to go outside the box how to
(54:42) alter your attention how do you change
(54:46) your perspective on what's so what's
(54:49) salient to you what's relevant how to
(54:52) alter what's important or real to you
(54:56) now what shamanism is is it's a set of
(55:01) practices disruptive practices and
(55:04) attentional practices that are designed
(55:07) to disrupt everyday framing so that the
(55:12) shaman can get enhanced insight well now
(55:15) what kind of insight insight into
(55:17) patterns in the environment
(55:20) that other people might not be picking
(55:22) up on enhanced insight mine site into
(55:26) other people and and and here's this
(55:31) that the sense of participatory knowing
(55:33) that I mentioned when the shaman is
(55:35) enacting the animal the shaman isn't
(55:37) having beliefs about the deer the shaman
(55:40) is becoming the deer I don't mean
(55:43) metaphysically but the shaman is trying
(55:45) to get together the sense of the skills
(55:48) the way the kind of perspective the deer
(55:52) has the way the deer thinks the kind of
(55:54) world the deer lives in and by becoming
(55:58) the deer by having this participatory
(56:00) knowing of what it is to be a deer it
(56:02) enhances the ability to track and find
(56:04) the deer now these enhanced capacities
(56:08) for insight and mindsight participatory
(56:13) knowing means the shaman combines a lot
(56:17) of things that are for us in separate
(56:18) individuals shamans are highly
(56:19) charismatic imagine if you could take a
(56:25) rock star like a super rock star a super
(56:30) therapist a super artist put them all in
(56:34) one individual and then they come to you
(56:35) when you're sick they can enhance your
(56:41) ability to trigger your own placebo
(56:45) effect the placebo effect is real 30 to
(56:49) 40 percent of all real medication the
(56:51) ones we sell as real drugs is placebo
(56:55) effect if you have an individual can
(56:58) they can trigger that and that's all you
(57:00) have at that time that's still thirty to
(57:03) forty two percent better than you had
(57:05) before see so what are the shamans doing
(57:14) notice what they're doing they're really
(57:17) enhancing their capacity for cognition
(57:21) now what we're going to do in the next
(57:24) video
(57:24) is we're going to come back to the
(57:26) shamans we're going to talk more about
(57:28) what they're doing how they're enhancing
(57:33) their cognition and why this played such
(57:36) an important role in making human beings
(57:38) into the kind of meaning makers there
(57:40) are but we'll see what it is right but
(57:44) you can see already notice in order to
(57:47) tap into all these kinds of knowings in
(57:50) order to bring about this altered state
(57:52) of consciousness notice how much that
(57:54) shaman is manipulating the meaning of
(57:57) things which isn't the same thing as
(58:00) being a charlatan so we're starting to
(58:05) see right from the beginning the
(58:07) connections between meaning making
(58:09) altered states of consciousness and
(58:11) enhanced capacity to be in touch with
(58:15) the world and then what's the connection
(58:17) to wisdom the word shaman means one who
(58:21) knows one who sees one who has insight
(58:26) shamans are considered wise people and
(58:30) that's what you know that's why we have
(58:33) all these words that the word wizard
(58:35) means a wise person okay so that's it
(58:42) for our first video and get a sense from
(58:46) this of how we're going to proceed thank
(58:52) you very much for your time
(58:54) [Music]
(59:11) you
