(00:00) [Music]
(00:04) you
(00:04) [Music]
(00:14) welcome back I'm John Bravo key and this
(00:17) is a video series on awakening from the
(00:20) meaning crisis so last time we were
(00:23) beginning our historical examination of
(00:26) the origin of this capacity for meaning
(00:29) making to try and get a clearer picture
(00:31) of what it is
(00:32) and today I'd like to continue on with
(00:34) that we were talking about the
(00:36) connections between meaning making
(00:38) enhancing cognition altered states of
(00:42) consciousness wisdom and we were talking
(00:44) about that in connection with the upper
(00:47) paleolithic transition in which human
(00:51) beings seem to have gone through this
(00:52) radical change which was not so much a
(00:55) biological change but a change in how
(00:57) they were using their cognition we
(00:59) talked about important ideas such as
(01:01) cognitive exaptation and psycho
(01:03) technology and we talked about how the
(01:06) upper paleolithic transition was
(01:08) probably driven by the way shamanism was
(01:11) a set of psycho technologies for
(01:13) altering states of consciousness to
(01:16) cognitively exact the enhanced abilities
(01:19) that trade rituals and initiation
(01:20) rituals and healing rituals had already
(01:22) been creating and we talked about the
(01:28) the way the shaman engaged in various
(01:32) disruptive strategies to try and alter
(01:35) their framing of reality because how we
(01:38) frame reality is both the source of our
(01:42) adaptability our ability to find
(01:44) patterns but it is also how we can get
(01:46) locked in how we miss frame reality and
(01:49) how we are in need of insight and when
(01:50) we talked about that in connection for
(01:53) something like that the nine dot problem
(01:55) and that led us to realize that there's
(01:57) kinds of knowing that are independent
(01:59) from the knowing that we capture in our
(02:02) statements of our beliefs
(02:03) there's knowings about knowing how to do
(02:05) something what it's like to have a
(02:08) particular perspective and what it's
(02:10) like to know something by identifying
(02:11) with it and participating in it and I
(02:16) was starting to show you how the shaman
(02:19) altered state of consciousness was also
(02:22) enhancing and altering meaning making
(02:25) affording insight and improving the
(02:29) ability of the shaman to help in hunting
(02:31) in health care two things that would
(02:33) radically improve survival I want to
(02:35) continue now and talking more about that
(02:38) or more about what's going on in
(02:40) shamanism in order to get more
(02:42) explication of this meaning-making
(02:45) wisdom altered states of consciousness
(02:48) different kinds of knowing and how
(02:50) they're all interrelated together so
(02:54) typically the the shaman engages in
(02:56) practices that are putting significant
(03:00) changes in their attention as we
(03:03) mentioned there's often significant
(03:05) disruptive strategies sleep deprivation
(03:07) sexed-up privation social isolation the
(03:10) use of psychedelics extended chanting
(03:12) all of these dancing all of these things
(03:16) are designed to bring about radical
(03:19) changes in the way in which the brain is
(03:21) operating now part of what a shaman is
(03:25) doing is I would argue also getting into
(03:29) the flow state so the flow state has
(03:33) become something that discussed both
(03:37) academically and in the popular culture
(03:38) it was made famous in work by chicks at
(03:42) ma high his book flow the flow
(03:45) experience brought it to the forefront
(03:48) in 1990 so what is the flow experience
(03:52) so the flow experience is experience
(03:55) people get into they often describe it
(03:56) as like being in the zone so you are
(04:00) involved in a task that is very
(04:02) demanding in fact it has a particular
(04:05) structure to it so these are your skills
(04:10) and these is how demanding the situation
(04:14) is right and the flow state is one in
(04:18) which the demands of the situation just
(04:20) slightly go beyond your skill abilities
(04:24) and so you get what's called here
(04:28) Csikszentmihalyi often represents this
(04:29) by the flow channel right when my skills
(04:33) can just through we'll talk about this
(04:36) through like sort of insight and
(04:37) restructuring
(04:38) I can just enough exact and extend my
(04:42) skills to meet the demand so I have to
(04:43) put everything I've got into it then I
(04:46) get into the flow channel if my skills
(04:47) exceed the demands I fall into boredom
(04:50) if my demands exceed the skills alright
(04:55) I fall into anxiety now of course the
(04:57) thing about you is you're very good at
(04:59) learning in situation so you need a kind
(05:02) of context in which your skills as your
(05:06) skills improve your environment also
(05:08) improves so one of the things we've
(05:11) created in our culture if we have
(05:13) created flow induction machines because
(05:18) what what those machines that have are a
(05:22) situation where your skills are
(05:24) constantly improving and the demands on
(05:26) the environment are constantly improving
(05:27) and the skill induction these are these
(05:30) flow induction machines have other
(05:31) properties that are very important in
(05:34) them there's a very tight feedback
(05:36) between what you do and how the
(05:37) environment responds you're getting very
(05:39) clear information and failure matters
(05:43) it's like at least symbolically because
(05:46) you can die and of course some of you
(05:48) are probably realizing that I'm talking
(05:49) about video games video games are one of
(05:53) the most reliable ways of inducing the
(05:57) flow state in people in fact part of the
(06:00) reasons why video games are addictive
(06:02) and they now being considered to be a
(06:04) bonafide addiction by the World Health
(06:05) Organization is precisely because they
(06:08) engender the flow state addictions and
(06:10) we'll talk about this later when we talk
(06:11) about addictions addictions runoff
(06:13) machinery that is evolutionarily
(06:15) adaptive that's why it's compelling
(06:18) so the flow state what are other things
(06:24) that people do to get into the flow
(06:25) state they play jazz they do martial
(06:28) arts oh I'm a martial artist right one
(06:30) that's particularly interesting because
(06:32) there's no other explanation for why
(06:34) people do it other than you get into the
(06:37) flow state is rock climbing because rock
(06:39) climbing otherwise would be like it's
(06:41) it's like some sort of torture from
(06:43) Greek mythology right you presented it
(06:45) like here's a rock face what I want you
(06:47) to do is I want you to go up that it's
(06:49) gonna be really physically demanding
(06:50) it's going
(06:51) hurt you you might fall to you and harm
(06:53) yourself and once you get to the top you
(06:55) come back down it would seem like a
(06:58) torturous thing to do well we know why
(07:00) people rock climb they rock climb
(07:02) because they get into the flow state and
(07:04) the flow state is deeply deeply positive
(07:07) for people it's not the same thing as
(07:08) physical pleasure right in fact the flow
(07:13) state is much more connected to meaning
(07:15) in life in fact the more often you get
(07:18) into the flow State the more likely you
(07:20) will rate your your life as a meaningful
(07:23) the more the more you will experience
(07:25) well-being now what's interesting also
(07:28) about the flow State and remember we're
(07:30) doing this because I'm talking about
(07:31) that shamanism is probably a practice
(07:34) for practicing getting into the flow
(07:36) state so remember that right the thing
(07:39) about the flow state it's a universal
(07:41) people across cultures socio-economic
(07:45) groups genders language environments age
(07:49) groups report being able to get into the
(07:52) flow state and they describe it in
(07:55) detail almost exactly the same way
(07:57) that's a universal and universals are
(08:00) important in cognitive science you pay
(08:02) attention to the universals because they
(08:04) give you profound insight into the
(08:06) machinery what's it like to be in the
(08:10) flow state well when you're in the flow
(08:13) state right you feel like you're deeply
(08:16) at one with things so for example I'm a
(08:20) martial artist and when I'm sparring
(08:21) it's like my sense of connectedness to
(08:24) my opponent is really enhanced and I'm
(08:28) really at one and that comes with it
(08:32) this kind of spontaneity so when one
(08:36) does when a strike is coming to my hand
(08:38) is just it I don't sort of raise your
(08:41) head now John it flows out of me hence
(08:45) the word right and the block is there
(08:49) the hockey player the goalie just puts
(08:53) out his hand the glove hand and the puck
(08:55) is there there's this tremendous sense
(08:57) of at one MIT and then closely allied to
(08:59) it is this right
(09:02) at one level you know like the shaman
(09:06) dancing or chanting that there's
(09:08) tremendous metabolic energy at work
(09:12) effort you're making at one level all
(09:14) this effort but at another level
(09:18) it feels effortless that's the
(09:20) spontaneity again it just seems to flow
(09:23) from you your sense of time is passing
(09:27) differently your sense of self is being
(09:34) dramatically altered so when people are
(09:38) in the flow state right their self kind
(09:42) of self-consciousness disappears that
(09:45) self-consciously
(09:46) you know we carry around that
(09:46) self-consciousness that that's always
(09:49) doing this this sort of thing it's
(09:51) constantly sort of doing our
(09:52) autobiography how's my day going how I'm
(09:54) doing who am i what am i doing
(09:55) blah blah and it's also checking how do
(09:57) i image management how do I look what
(09:59) are people think of me how am i doing am
(10:00) i under threat all of that nattering and
(10:02) all my failing I was I knew and and that
(10:05) of course and that can get out of hand
(10:07) and was like when you're in depression
(10:09) you ruminate on all that stuff and it
(10:11) overwhelms you but we all carry that
(10:13) burden around it's taxing and the thing
(10:15) in the flow state it's gone because
(10:20) there's no space for all of that because
(10:22) you're so right engrossed in the task
(10:27) the other thing about the flow state is
(10:30) it's super salient like it's like it's
(10:34) like like it's like the kind of
(10:35) brightness and vividness you get in a
(10:38) video game the world seems more intense
(10:42) and people really like this experience
(10:47) and not only do they like it it seems to
(10:52) be where they do their best work
(10:54) so the flow experience is an optimal
(10:56) experience in two ways many people
(10:59) regard it as the best experiences they
(11:01) can have but it's also where they're
(11:06) doing their very best at what they want
(11:08) to excel in that's why it's so
(11:13) motivating to get into the flow State
(11:18) so why is the flow state so good so this
(11:28) year 2018 I published some work with
(11:33) Adrian Havana and Leo Ferraro in which
(11:36) we tried to argue for what the cognitive
(11:40) mechanisms are in the flow States see
(11:41) chicks at mahai tells you the
(11:44) environmental conditions what you need
(11:46) in order to get into the flow state you
(11:48) need skills and demand to be matched you
(11:56) need to be very tight coupling between
(11:59) you and the environment like in the
(12:00) video game you need very clear
(12:02) information it can't be ambiguous or
(12:04) vague and failure has to matter it has
(12:06) to be costly to you in some fashion
(12:09) specified all of that you also specified
(12:12) the kind of training that helps enhance
(12:14) you get to get you into the flow State
(12:17) and think about this think about what I
(12:20) said last time and we're gonna explore
(12:24) this more training and mindfulness the
(12:26) more people have training and
(12:27) mindfulness increases their capacity to
(12:29) get into the flow state now can we come
(12:32) up with a unified explanation for all of
(12:34) this I think we can both for the
(12:38) phenomenology why we're experiencing
(12:40) what we're experiencing when we're in
(12:42) the flow State and why is it improving
(12:45) your cognition and therefore why would
(12:48) the shaman be enhancing their cognition
(12:50) by getting into something like the flow
(12:52) state through their ritual practices ok
(12:56) so think about the rock climber okay the
(13:00) rock climber is climbing remember we
(13:04) talked about how you frame and find
(13:05) patterns last time remember the nine dot
(13:08) problem right and that these patterns
(13:11) aren't just patterns in your mind
(13:14) they're patterns in how knowing how to
(13:16) make sense of things
(13:17) so you're rock climbing and if that
(13:21) breaks down you impasse you're stuck and
(13:24) I don't mean just cognitively you're
(13:26) physically stuck now if you want to be a
(13:29) good rock
(13:29) what you have to do is you have to break
(13:31) that framing you have to train yourself
(13:35) to break the frame restructure change
(13:38) what you're finding relevant and salient
(13:40) and then change yourself to fit that and
(13:44) then you've refit yourself to the rock
(13:47) face you refit yourself to the rock face
(13:52) then you have to do it again and then
(13:55) you have to do it again and then you
(13:57) have to do it again
(13:58) well the jazz musician the jazz musician
(14:00) is playing they pick up on a pattern and
(14:02) they play with it but they can't stay
(14:04) with it too long whether they have to do
(14:05) they have to shift they have to
(14:06) restructure they have to shift into a
(14:08) new pattern and then play with that but
(14:09) they can't stay with it too long they
(14:11) have to pick up on it they have to
(14:12) refrain again and again and again and
(14:14) again and again do you see what's going
(14:17) on with the rock climber the jazz
(14:22) musician the martial artist is this idea
(14:25) of a cascade of insights you're having
(14:29) an insight that's leading to another
(14:31) insight that's leading to another
(14:33) insight right it's priming so you know
(14:37) when you have like an insight you have
(14:38) like aha and you get that sort of burst
(14:41) of energy and it's like a flash that's
(14:44) why we put a light bulb over somebody's
(14:45) head when we want to show them having an
(14:47) insight it's like that flash now imagine
(14:50) if I took that aha and I extended it aha
(14:55) that's the flow State it's an inchoate
(14:59) so the more you flow the more you're
(15:03) training your ability for insight in
(15:09) direct interacting with your environment
(15:12) now the trouble of course with the video
(15:14) game is year though the environment is
(15:16) into real world but in the shaman's
(15:20) world of course the shamans flowing in
(15:23) the real world the real social world the
(15:25) real ecological world but there's
(15:29) something more it's not just an insight
(15:31) cascade that's going on and flow died it
(15:33) died in and of itself would be great
(15:35) there's something else going this has to
(15:37) do with your capacity for implicit
(15:39) learning now notice what's happening
(15:42) here notice that although even I'm doing
(15:43) the history I'm always also doing the
(15:47) cogs side because wall I'll be
(15:49) emphasizing the history the historical
(15:51) account I'm starting to build what I
(15:54) need to give you the structural
(15:55) functional account ok so implicit
(15:59) learning this goes back to work done in
(16:04) the 60s by Arthur Reber and a whole
(16:07) bunch of other people so what Reber was
(16:11) doing is he he was really trying to
(16:12) understand how people learn language
(16:14) what he was doing was he was generating
(16:16) an arbitrary set of rules completely
(16:18) arbitrary just make them up on the spot
(16:20) set of rules for how you can link
(16:23) strings of letters and/or numbers
(16:24) together like the rule might be you
(16:26) can't have more than three vowels in a
(16:28) row or you have to have two consonants
(16:30) and then you generate you generate
(16:32) letter strings eight nine long these are
(16:36) so long that you can't sort of easily
(16:38) hold them in your working memory and
(16:40) then this is what you do you take you
(16:42) generate you can generate an indefinite
(16:45) number you generate a huge number of
(16:46) these strings and you show them to
(16:49) people here's one here's one here's one
(16:51) here's one here's one here's one okay
(16:55) that's the first part of the experiment
(16:56) then you do the second part of the
(16:59) experiment
(16:59) now you generate a whole bunch of
(17:02) strings but two kinds one set of strings
(17:06) is generated by the
(17:08) that artificial set of rules and so
(17:10) follows the same rules as the first
(17:12) string first set and then the second set
(17:16) is generated by a completely different
(17:18) set of rules okay and what you do is you
(17:21) mix up the first and the second together
(17:24) and this is the task you give people can
(17:26) you tell me the strings that belong with
(17:30) the strings you saw before there you go
(17:35) now weber originally thought what would
(17:38) happen is people would because it seems
(17:41) like so random what he found was people
(17:45) score well well above chance
(17:47) consistently on this people can tell you
(17:49) oh no those strings yeah those belong
(17:52) with though the old ones no that one
(17:54) doesn't that one does that one doesn't
(17:55) now here's what's interesting you now
(17:58) ask people why how do you know that and
(18:01) they'll give you one of two answers
(18:02) they'll say I don't know I don't know I
(18:05) just I just feel it which is whoo or
(18:11) they say they give you some explanation
(18:14) they'll give you some rule the procedure
(18:16) they're using and here's what we know
(18:18) they're deceiving themselves or lying to
(18:21) you because that rule that they're using
(18:23) wouldn't actually predict their success
(18:28) so you are picking up you have this
(18:31) tremendous capacity outside your
(18:33) conscious awareness right to pick up on
(18:37) very complex patterns in your
(18:39) environment and you say okay why what
(18:43) does this have to do with shamanism well
(18:44) hang on because we talked about the
(18:46) shaman picking up on patterns last time
(18:49) let's go back to this let me talk about
(18:52) an experiment that's really interesting
(18:53) so there was some work done on this idea
(18:58) you know the people have psychic
(19:00) abilities and there was a feeling of
(19:02) being stared at the people can tell when
(19:04) they're being stared at and people
(19:05) reliably report that they think oh I
(19:07) knew somebody was staring I could just
(19:08) feel it in the back of my neck and stuff
(19:10) like that so they ran an experiment in
(19:12) which they did the following they'd have
(19:13) somebody in a room blindfolded ear
(19:17) plugged the kids sense anything nobody's
(19:19) allowed to wear perfumes or anything
(19:20) that person can't see
(19:21) here feel and they're just standing in
(19:23) the room unbeknownst to that person
(19:26) and in people would come in and stare at
(19:29) them and then they had to report him the
(19:31) person at the center of the room had to
(19:32) reported they were being stared at or
(19:34) not and people were reporting this well
(19:37) above chance they were saying I think
(19:40) I'm being stared at and there was
(19:41) somebody there and of course first of
(19:44) all there's ooh right but then it turned
(19:48) out that if you made a slight change to
(19:53) that experiment it wouldn't replicate so
(19:57) what was going on you bring people into
(19:59) the room and they say I think I'm being
(20:03) stared at and the researchers would tell
(20:05) them if they were correct or not they
(20:07) would say you're right or you're wrong
(20:10) so what'd you say so what well here's
(20:13) the thing
(20:14) the researchers thought they were
(20:16) introducing people the viewers into the
(20:19) room randomly but it turns out they
(20:22) weren't introducing them randomly
(20:24) because you know it's very hard for you
(20:25) to do random stuff they were actually
(20:28) introducing people as viewers in a
(20:32) complex pattern and the person that was
(20:35) blindfolded and ear plugged was
(20:37) implicitly learning the pattern because
(20:40) they were getting feedback if you take
(20:42) the feedback away if you don't tell them
(20:44) whenever they say I'm being stared out
(20:45) or not if you don't tell them they're -
(20:47) right or wrong their performance drops -
(20:49) chance see a lot of what looks like
(20:53) psychic abilities are your ability to
(20:56) pick up implicitly on complex patterns
(20:59) in the environment without being aware
(21:01) of it so hogarth in his book on
(21:07) educating intuition made a really really
(21:09) cool really cool claim makes a very good
(21:12) argument in fact I think for this he
(21:14) says that what we call intuition is a
(21:17) real thing but there isn't anything sort
(21:21) of magical about it in there like the
(21:22) psychics say or something like that your
(21:25) intuition is the result of your implicit
(21:27) learning you pick up on all kinds of
(21:31) complex patterns not knowing how you
(21:33) have done that
(21:34) and but you get an ability to detect
(21:38) patterns and you don't know how that's
(21:40) why your intuition feels the way it does
(21:42) you just sort of know like you know
(21:45) things you're doing it all the time to
(21:48) use a famous example from Dreyfuss you
(21:49) know how far to stand from somebody and
(21:56) what angle to stick like where you
(21:58) should stand how close you should stand
(22:00) what angle you should stand how as the
(22:02) conversation or the context changes
(22:03) you're allowed to move closer or farther
(22:05) away what angles you're allowed to be at
(22:07) but rather to ask you to tell me how you
(22:10) do that you wouldn't know you would just
(22:13) say I know how to do it and yet when
(22:16) people don't know how to do it it creeps
(22:19) you out it creeps you out okay so
(22:25) intuition
(22:26) now hogarth points out and this is
(22:31) something very common right hold our
(22:32) points so that you know we have two
(22:34) different terms and we don't realize
(22:35) we're talking about the same thing we
(22:39) have intuition when we think it's going
(22:41) well
(22:41) that implicit learning but we also have
(22:45) bias and Prejudice for when we think
(22:48) that implicit learning goes bad the
(22:50) bigot has got intuitions about races
(22:54) that are wrong now why is how is it that
(22:59) implicit learning goes wrong well here's
(23:02) the thing you have some complex pattern
(23:05) in the environment right and your
(23:08) implicit learning picks up on it the
(23:12) problem is there's two kinds of patterns
(23:14) in your environment
(23:14) there's correlations there's correlation
(23:18) patterns and causal parts on what do I
(23:20) mean by the correlations is what any two
(23:22) things are related to each other so let
(23:26) me give you an example of a couple of
(23:28) correlations that you shouldn't confuse
(23:30) with causation there is a correlation
(23:32) between how large your wedding is and
(23:35) how long your marriage will last if you
(23:38) have a bigger wedding your marriage will
(23:40) last longer now you would be a fool to
(23:44) therefore think you should have the
(23:46) biggest possible wedding
(23:47) because the reason why bigger weddings
(23:50) predict longer marriages is not because
(23:52) bigger weddings cause longer marriages
(23:56) is because right there only correlated
(23:59) it's because bigger weddings reflect a
(24:01) bigger social network more financial
(24:03) resources and having a bigger social
(24:05) network for the couple having more
(24:07) financial resources actually does cause
(24:09) a marriage to last longer here's another
(24:12) one
(24:13) so I'm old enough right and I was
(24:17) brought up in a religious household that
(24:19) I was you know when prayer was taken out
(24:22) of the schools and of course people were
(24:25) very upset about that and you're taking
(24:27) look at crime as going up as we've taken
(24:29) prayer out of the schools and things
(24:30) like that
(24:31) by the way crime hasn't been going up
(24:33) and read some of Steven Pinker's work
(24:34) but let's say it was that's only a
(24:37) correlation because here's another
(24:39) correlation we know that greenhouse
(24:42) gases have been going up steadily and
(24:46) that's part of the environmental crisis
(24:48) we're going to talk about you know what
(24:49) has been also consistently going down
(24:51) for the exact same time period Caribbean
(24:53) piracy having pirates in the Caribbean
(24:56) and wooden ships with cannons and stuff
(24:57) as that went down greenhouse gases went
(25:00) up now I hope none of you think that we
(25:03) could solve global warming by being back
(25:06) piracy ok so there are many things that
(25:11) there are many patterns in the world
(25:13) that are illusory because they're only
(25:15) correlational they're not causal see the
(25:18) big yet has picked up on correlational
(25:21) patterns not causal patterns so what you
(25:25) want to do is you want to train your
(25:27) implicit learning to pick up on the
(25:32) causal patterns that are real rather
(25:34) than the correlational patterns that are
(25:38) looser now here's what you can't do you
(25:40) can't tell people to look for patterns
(25:42) explicitly go back to rebirth experiment
(25:45) if you put people into that experiment
(25:47) where they're looking at the letter
(25:48) strings and you tell them explicitly
(25:50) what they're supposed to do try and
(25:51) figure out the rules consciously
(25:53) deliberately try to figure out the rules
(25:55) their performance doesn't get better it
(25:58) gets worse
(26:00) okay and hogarth notes this in his book
(26:05) on educating intuition we can't replace
(26:07) implicit learning with explicit learning
(26:09) because it is precisely by being
(26:11) implicit that it works so well what can
(26:14) we do explicitly then what we can do is
(26:17) set up the right context the right
(26:20) environmental factors so that my
(26:23) implicit learning machine will tend more
(26:27) likely to get on to causal patterns
(26:29) rather than correlational patterns so
(26:31) I'll get good intuition rather than bad
(26:34) intuition how do you do that well Hogar
(26:40) says the way you would do this is the
(26:41) way you do science you want to control
(26:44) the context right
(26:46) because what science is and you know
(26:49) there's a lot of our science book
(26:51) science is a way of distinguishing
(26:53) causal patterns from correlational
(26:55) patterns you set up an environmental
(26:57) situation so that you can distinguish
(26:59) the causal patterns from the
(27:01) correlational patterns what do you do
(27:05) well in an experiment first of all I
(27:07) make sure that everything is very
(27:11) clearly measured I get very clear
(27:13) information very clear information I
(27:16) make sure I'm looking to see that right
(27:20) that the change in one variable is
(27:23) closely followed by a change in another
(27:25) variable so I change your drug dosage do
(27:28) your symptoms get better right so I look
(27:31) for clear information I look for clear
(27:33) feedback and in science failure matters
(27:36) you test the hypothesis and this
(27:39) confirmation has to be possible failure
(27:42) matters now notice this what hoga says
(27:44) is well what I want to do is I want to I
(27:46) want to put you into an implicit
(27:48) learning situation where you get clear
(27:50) feedback like you do in science where
(27:53) there is a tight coupling between what
(27:55) you do and how the environment responds
(27:57) and where error really matters like in
(28:00) science and he says what we should do is
(28:04) we should try and do implicit learning
(28:05) in those kinds of contexts well here's
(28:11) what myself and my colleagues argued
(28:13) those three criteria that will turn your
(28:16) intuition into good implicit learning
(28:18) are exactly the conditions for flow
(28:21) clear information tightly coupled
(28:25) feedback and error matters the
(28:29) rock-climber is looking for creates
(28:32) clear information tightly coupled
(28:35) feedback and error really matters that
(28:38) context really means that there's a much
(28:42) greater chance that their implicit
(28:43) learning machinery is going to pick up
(28:45) on causal patterns rather than
(28:47) correlational ones so notice what we've
(28:52) got going on here the shaman is getting
(28:55) into the flow state is developing all
(28:57) these techniques for getting into this
(28:59) deeply immersive comprehensive flow
(29:05) state and they're getting an insight
(29:09) cascade and they're also getting
(29:13) enhanced implicit learning picking up on
(29:22) very complex real complex patterns now
(29:27) this is intuitive they don't know how
(29:29) they're doing it now here's what's
(29:33) interesting - these two are reinforcing
(29:37) each other because the insight gets your
(29:41) cognition to explore for new patterns
(29:43) and then the implicit learning picks up
(29:47) those new plans and then those new
(29:49) patterns enhance your ability to
(29:51) restructure and then right you keep
(29:55) exploring for new patterns acquiring the
(29:57) new patterns for implicit learning and
(29:59) you keep ratcheting your skills up
(30:01) getting into the flow State is deeply
(30:05) deeply enhancing of your cognition
(30:07) somebody who's an expert at getting into
(30:11) the flow State is going to be an
(30:13) individual you want to have around
(30:14) now that individual is going to have
(30:16) some really serious challenges facing
(30:19) them they don't know how they're getting
(30:21) a lot of the information they're getting
(30:22) they don't know why they're so
(30:24) insightful they don't and they're
(30:26) experiencing this radical at one minute
(30:28) the world this loss of sense of self
(30:30) when they're enacting the animal right
(30:33) you have to understand these insights
(30:35) aren't verbal insights like in the nine
(30:37) dot problem it's not words it's not
(30:40) beliefs getting an insight and how the
(30:42) deer moves it's getting an insight and
(30:44) the intuitive insight and how to talk to
(30:46) this person to trigger the placebo
(30:48) effect to help them to heal right now so
(30:56) getting into the flow state notice
(31:00) what's going on here notice you're
(31:02) getting something that's almost like a
(31:03) mystical experience it's a powerful
(31:05) altered state of consciousness it's
(31:08) enhancing your cognitive processing and
(31:10) the shaman is making meaning they're
(31:13) singing they're dancing they're telling
(31:15) stories they're altering people's sense
(31:18) of what matters they're altering
(31:19) people's sense of identity they're
(31:21) healing and transforming people
(31:32) what does that mean why would that
(31:35) empower the upper paleolithic transition
(31:37) well first of all this is enhancing your
(31:40) cognition but and this is goes towards
(31:45) the work of Michael Winckelmann and also
(31:47) not Rossano what's happening in this
(31:51) state is your brain is learning to get
(31:54) areas to talk to each other that
(31:56) normally don't talk to each other
(31:57) this is especially the case if you've
(32:00) gone through a massive disruption
(32:02) strategy fasting social isolation taking
(32:06) psychedelics because what if you look at
(32:11) a brain scan of somebody who's having a
(32:13) psychedelic experience areas of the
(32:16) brain that do not not normally do not
(32:18) talk to each other are talking to each
(32:20) other now now if I were just to do that
(32:24) to you if I was just to get areas to
(32:26) talk to each other you'd experience that
(32:27) as noise but if you've got enhanced
(32:33) insight and enhanced intuition those
(32:37) areas are now talking to each other and
(32:38) you can bridge between them you can
(32:42) connect them and now this is an ability
(32:44) you take for granted you think it is
(32:48) just the normal part of your cognition
(32:51) this is your capacity for metaphor
(32:59) the word metaphor is itself a metaphor
(33:02) it means to bridge to carry over to
(33:04) connect things that are normally not
(33:05) connected and what you need to
(33:09) understand is how pervasive metaphor is
(33:11) I showed you a little bit last time the
(33:15) idea of a project but I want you to
(33:19) reflect now I notice the word reflect is
(33:22) a metaphor on how your thought and
(33:26) language is filled with it with metaphor
(33:29) by the word that was a metaphor I'll say
(33:32) for example do you see what I'm saying
(33:35) do you get my point do you comprehend it
(33:40) can you grasp it do you understand it
(33:43) these are all metaphors I'm about
(33:47) halfway through this talk I hope it's
(33:53) not too hard for you do you see it's
(34:01) pervasive and profound all of your
(34:04) cognition this is work done by Lake off
(34:06) and others I have some criticisms of
(34:08) some of their theory but the ideas that
(34:09) your cognition is field and functions
(34:14) through metaphorical enhancement it's
(34:19) just I think the case now why is
(34:24) metaphor so powerful because metaphor is
(34:28) how you make creative connections
(34:32) between ideas metaphorical cognition as
(34:38) is at the heart of both science and art
(34:44) when the shamans are enhancing this
(34:49) machinery they're connecting areas of
(34:53) the brain that normally didn't talk to
(34:56) each other and affording a massive
(34:58) enhancement in metaphor one of the ways
(35:02) in which your cognition and meaning and
(35:05) altered states of consciousness come
(35:07) together is in how your
(35:11) mind you're in embodied mind is
(35:17) generating metaphor in order to make
(35:20) insightful connections there's a deep
(35:23) connection between how insightful how
(35:26) good a problem-solver you are and your
(35:30) capacity for metaphorical thought that's
(35:31) why when somebody is facing a problem
(35:34) and they need to restructure how they
(35:36) think about it we tell them to use an
(35:39) analogy to think of a metaphor so this
(35:44) is the point the shaman is developing
(35:49) psycho technologies for altering the
(35:52) state of consciousness to get into the
(35:53) flow state and that flow state is
(35:57) already making them more insightful and
(35:59) more intuitively powerful but it is also
(36:02) making them generators of metaphor
(36:07) literally providing people with the
(36:11) forms of thought that will allow them to
(36:13) connect ideas such that making
(36:16) inscriptions on a piece of bone can
(36:19) track the moon carving this figurine can
(36:26) connect me to ideas of fertility so
(36:34) we're seeing a lot of the themes that
(36:37) we're going to develop coming to the
(36:40) fore here how much right the shaman
(36:48) is weaving together enhancing cognition
(36:54) altered states of consciousness and
(36:58) improving our capacity for making sense
(37:04) of the world literally making more
(37:06) meaning if you have if you're a hundred
(37:15) rather grew pand you have a shaman
(37:17) you're gonna out-compete groups that
(37:19) don't there's a reason why it's
(37:23) universal there's a reason why the flow
(37:24) phenomena is universal because this
(37:28) exact some of our most basic machinery
(37:30) enhances it in a powerful way
(37:37) now the shamans have a very interesting
(37:45) kind of experience they go through this
(37:49) transformation they often experience
(37:52) what's called soul flight as if they've
(37:54) gone to another world and they're flying
(37:56) through it this is the origin
(38:00) I mean think of how we've come to this
(38:04) but this is the origin of getting high
(38:08) and the shaman does this the shaman
(38:12) experiences themselves as if they're
(38:14) flying above the world why why would the
(38:18) brain generate that well think about
(38:23) this the shaman is getting a much more
(38:29) comprehensive grasp of more complex
(38:31) patterns but they're experiencing it
(38:34) mostly intuitively and metaphorically
(38:37) where are you when you get a bigger
(38:39) picture of things you're above them how
(38:43) do we often explain this even to
(38:46) ourselves metaphorically right you you
(38:48) have oversight somebody who is in charge
(38:51) of things has oversight of them or has
(38:56) super vision of them do you see that
(39:05) those are metaphors those are metaphors
(39:09) that are little whispers little echoes
(39:10) of shamanic flight flying over things
(39:13) getting a getting an intuitive
(39:16) insightful grasp that is expressed
(39:19) metaphorically of a deeper connection to
(39:23) the world we're gonna pick up on all of
(39:26) these themes as we investigate more than
(39:30) machinery of meaning making they need to
(39:34) move forward now so I want to talk about
(39:37) another revolution
(39:39) this was the Upper Paleolithic
(39:41) transition this is where the
(39:43) meaning-making machinery the altered
(39:45) altering consciousness the self
(39:48) transcending the flying above the
(39:51) cultivation of wisdom associated with a
(39:55) lot of things that we consider spiritual
(39:57) and religious you see them all together
(40:00) that's the Upper Paleolithic transition
(40:02) now there is another important
(40:05) revolution that into that takes place
(40:06) around 10,000 BCE
(40:08) that's the Neolithic Revolution you get
(40:11) the invention of agriculture the
(40:15) agriculture is important because it adds
(40:18) to this machinery an important way
(40:23) because now individuals are part of
(40:25) complex societies and for the first time
(40:28) because of agriculture people start to
(40:33) stay in one place for significant
(40:36) amounts of time so their relationship to
(40:39) the environment to each other because
(40:41) they're living with large groups of
(40:42) strangers now and to themselves
(40:46) radically changes that goes to a very
(40:52) long period of development this world
(40:54) right of course then becomes the ancient
(40:58) world as stone gives way to metal and we
(41:04) get the Bronze Age the period of the
(41:07) first great civilizations in Mesopotamia
(41:10) in Egypt
(41:14) and there's a transformation that's
(41:17) happened and the way people are
(41:21) experiencing they're caught their world
(41:25) human beings are still doing everything
(41:28) we've been talking about they still have
(41:29) rituals of course they've developed them
(41:31) into very sophisticated complex systems
(41:34) they're still engaging in altered states
(41:37) of consciousness and that world is
(41:42) pervasive for a very long time but our
(41:47) connection to it is very odd so if I
(41:52) were to ask you if you've read anything
(41:54) from the Bronze Age chances are you
(41:56) haven't have you read the epic of
(41:58) gilgamesh well no probably not
(42:02) right have you read any Egyptian
(42:05) mythology
(42:06) probably not why the Sumerian
(42:11) Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations
(42:13) are titanically important long lasting
(42:16) but notice if I ask you if you've read
(42:20) parts of the Bible or perhaps Plato or
(42:24) perhaps some of the Buddha or Confucius
(42:29) chances aren't you you have read some of
(42:32) them you somehow feel that those people
(42:35) are relevant to you in a way that people
(42:38) from the Bronze Age aren't now why there
(42:44) seems to have been another great change
(42:49) comparable to the change of the Upper
(42:55) Paleolithic transition again whether
(42:59) it's a one-shot or more continuum again
(43:04) I'm I'm I don't need to decide that and
(43:07) I'm not confident that that debates
(43:08) around that are actually very fruitful
(43:10) the Karl Jasper's talked about the axial
(43:14) age Karen Armstrong has made famous that
(43:18) in a recent book
(43:23) so around 800 BCE
(43:31) around 300 BC there's this great change
(43:35) such that you will read connect to find
(43:41) relevant authors systems of thought ways
(43:45) of being from that time period and yet
(43:49) back here where the Bronze Age ends you
(43:53) don't read this stuff or at least most
(43:57) of you don't you don't find it relevant
(43:59) you don't identify with it something
(44:02) happened here that is formative of us
(44:05) just like the Upper Paleolithic
(44:07) transition was formative of us as human
(44:11) beings the axial age is formative of us
(44:14) as Western civilization or at least
(44:18) world civilization because it's not just
(44:21) in the West that the axial revolution
(44:22) occurs it also occurs in India and China
(44:29) now what happened why this change well
(44:35) there's a bunch of stuff that happens we
(44:39) don't quite know there's a lot of
(44:41) discussion about it but we know that
(44:44) Bronze Age collapses
(44:50) there's some good books by this book by
(44:53) Druze there's a book by Cline 1177 BCE
(44:59) right different discussions about why it
(45:05) collapsed was it a change in chariot
(45:07) warfare is it general systems failure is
(45:10) a combination of change in military
(45:12) technology don't know it doesn't matter
(45:17) for our purposes what we know is that
(45:19) the it's a collapse now you need to you
(45:23) need to grasp the gravity of this
(45:25) collapse this is the greatest collapse
(45:30) in civilization the world has ever known
(45:32) the fall of the Roman Empire is nowhere
(45:38) near as devastating as this more cities
(45:40) go out of existence
(45:42) at this time the Bronze Age collapse
(45:44) than any other time in recorded history
(45:47) more cultures disappear greatest loss of
(45:51) literacy greatest collapse of trade and
(45:53) car this is the closest thing the world
(45:57) is actually experienced to apocalypse
(46:00) the end of the world what happens here
(46:07) is a Dark Age so you have before this
(46:15) you have these like the Egyptian Empire
(46:18) these Titanic dinosaur empires huge and
(46:21) powerful lasting for centuries cultures
(46:26) that last millennia and then they
(46:27) disappear and what you would find in
(46:31) right is something like when the
(46:34) dinosaurs went extinct when the
(46:36) dinosaurs went extinct then little
(46:37) mammals that had been sort of scurrying
(46:40) about you know they start to evolve what
(46:42) you have
(46:43) once these dinosaur empires pass out of
(46:45) existence in the Dark Age is you have a
(46:47) lot of little small-scale societies
(46:49) people barely hanging on it's a very
(46:54) tough time another time in which there's
(46:57) a demand made on cognition to adapt
(47:01) remember the bottleneck in Africa
(47:05) preceding the upper paleolithic
(47:07) transition
(47:07) here's another bottle in that kind of
(47:09) event so people are more willing to
(47:20) experiment to try new things than they
(47:22) have before the faster willing to try
(47:24) new forms of social organization but
(47:29) importantly they start to invent new
(47:32) things and they start to invent new
(47:36) psycho technologies remember the last
(47:39) time we talked about what a psycho
(47:41) technology is it's a standardized way of
(47:43) doing information processing that
(47:46) improves and enhances your cognition by
(47:48) linking brains together your brain to
(47:51) your own future states of your brain you
(47:53) brain to other people's brains something
(47:58) happens here in one of the areas that
(48:00) was hit hardest by the Bronze Age
(48:02) collapse the area Palestine Palestine
(48:06) and what's modern Israel and Jordan
(48:08) places like that used to be the old
(48:12) referred to as the land of Canaan what
(48:17) seems to be invented here is a new kind
(48:20) of literacy I know we talked about
(48:23) literacy is a powerful psycho technology
(48:25) now the Bronze Age world had literacy
(48:29) the Egyptians had hieroglyphics famously
(48:31) the Sumerians had cuneiform now the
(48:35) thing about those forms of literacy is
(48:37) they're very difficult to learn you have
(48:39) to go to school for a very very long
(48:40) time and your job you're just you could
(48:45) your job you can have this job in the
(48:47) ancient world this was your job to be
(48:49) literate it's called being a scribe it's
(48:53) where we get words like scribble from
(48:56) all you were your entire job was you
(48:59) were literate because it was a tough
(49:00) thing to be literate and it was a very
(49:02) valuable thing and it was a rare thing
(49:05) because the literacy was hard when it's
(49:09) edia graphic so I have some ideograms
(49:11) tattooed here
(49:13) right this means meditate right what
(49:21) gets invented here is alphabetic
(49:23) literacy
(49:30) sort of it seems to be invented in
(49:32) Canaan and then it's taken up by the
(49:34) Phoenicians and then they take it to the
(49:35) Greeks and then the the proto that the
(49:39) Canaanite alphabet merges imperceptibly
(49:42) into archaic Hebrew and then gets taken
(49:45) into Hebrew that's gonna be important
(49:49) these two groups of people are going to
(49:50) be very important
(49:52) now why is alphabetic literacy so
(49:55) powerful it's much more learn about it's
(50:03) a more effective and efficient psycho
(50:05) technology remember what I said last
(50:08) time how much literacy enhances your
(50:11) cognition if I give you alphabetic
(50:15) literacy you can learn it much more
(50:19) powerfully and more people can learn it
(50:21) so your ability to learn and access and
(50:25) share with others the benefits of
(50:26) literacy gets magnified tremendously and
(50:34) what literate so the amount of people
(50:37) the number of people that can be
(50:38) literate expands now literacy does
(50:44) something very very important really
(50:47) really interesting in its effect on your
(50:51) sense of self and your sense of
(50:52) cognition as I noted before when I can
(50:56) write things down I can come back to my
(50:58) thoughts later and I can reflect on them
(51:00) I start to become more aware of my own
(51:04) thoughts and notice something else I can
(51:06) do I can correct my thinking more
(51:09) readily because I I don't have to rely
(51:12) on it being held in my mind I can put it
(51:14) I can externalize it I can put it out
(51:16) there I can reflect on it I can correct
(51:19) it I can store it independent of my
(51:22) memory so I start to get a capacity for
(51:29) what Robert Bellah calls second-order
(51:32) thinking
(51:43) now we all have metacognition we'll talk
(51:47) about this later
(51:47) metacognition is your awareness of your
(51:49) own mind I can ask you right now what
(51:51) are you thinking
(51:52) you can company become aware of it do
(51:55) you have a good memory yes or no you'll
(51:57) say I do or I don't
(51:58) that's metacognition it's your knowledge
(52:00) and awareness of your own mind
(52:01) we all have metacognition but one of the
(52:04) things you can do with literacy
(52:06) alphabetic literacy is you can
(52:08) internalize literacy into your
(52:10) metacognition so notice I'm becoming
(52:15) aware of my own cognition here I can
(52:19) reflect on it I can correct it I can
(52:21) enhance it I can store it I can share it
(52:25) with others second order thinking is
(52:29) when you internalize a psycho technology
(52:31) into your metacognition and it improves
(52:34) your capacity to critically examine your
(52:37) own thinking and correct your own
(52:40) thinking second order thinking starts to
(52:46) emerge because of alphabetic literacy
(52:48) what else is being invented at this time
(52:51) well you've got lots of armies moving
(52:56) around in this period because what's
(52:58) happening is empires are being rebuilt
(53:00) famously the Assyrian Empire in the
(53:03) Middle East
(53:05) mobile armies are needed
(53:10) and so there's an invention here that's
(53:12) really important that we also take for
(53:16) granted right it's the stuff we carry
(53:19) around well we used to carry it around
(53:21) we don't carry it around anymore we'll
(53:22) talk about that it's money
(53:24) coinage coinage is invented now quite as
(53:30) pointage is obviously a physical
(53:31) technology in one sense like carry coins
(53:33) around although the sense in which money
(53:35) is now physical is very very tenuous
(53:36) because most of us don't carry anything
(53:38) physical anymore money is disappear Li
(53:40) symbolic thing and that's the point
(53:43) money Treacher's you to think in an
(53:46) abstract symbol system you starts
(53:51) thinking in abstract symbol systems and
(53:54) it also teaches you something else
(53:56) numeracy you have to start thinking
(53:58) mathematically at least Aerith matically
(54:00) so you now have abstract symbolic
(54:04) logically rigorous thought being trained
(54:06) it's being trained for practical
(54:08) purposes but it's being trained it's
(54:10) ready for exaptation the alphabetic
(54:13) literacy is training this second order
(54:17) thinking it's ready for exaptation you
(54:22) say okay I get it
(54:25) the cycle technologies are training
(54:26) skills that are ready for exaptation
(54:28) well bring that second order thinking
(54:30) and bring that abstract symbolic thought
(54:34) more logically rigorous together and
(54:37) what are you going to start getting
(54:39) you're going to start getting people
(54:41) having a very bright clear sense of two
(54:47) things about their cognition one thing
(54:52) is how much they can correct their
(54:57) cognition how much they can transcend
(55:00) themselves self transcendence it
(55:02) enhances their sense of self
(55:03) transcendence but what's it also doing
(55:09) it's also enhancing their awareness of
(55:12) how self-deceptive they are
(55:16) how much error is in their cognition and
(55:22) they previously couldn't be aware of it
(55:23) but now with second-order thinking with
(55:26) literacy an abstract symbolic thought
(55:28) and numeracy they can become aware of
(55:30) this now you put those two together a
(55:32) tremendous capacity for self correction
(55:35) a tremendous capacity for self-deception
(55:39) and human being start to do something
(55:41) very differently they start to change
(55:43) their sense of self and their sense of
(55:44) the world they start to realize a more
(55:51) personal sense of responsibility which
(55:56) of course is gonna change how people
(55:57) think morally about themselves what I
(56:01) mean let me give you a specific example
(56:04) if you look before this time right
(56:07) people think of chaos and warfare and
(56:10) violence as just part of the natural
(56:12) order but after the axial revolution
(56:17) with the advent of second order thinking
(56:20) with this increased awareness of self
(56:23) transcendence and self correction people
(56:25) start to realize no no no we're
(56:27) responsible for the violence we're
(56:30) responsible for the chaos not just in
(56:32) some vague sense but it's the way my
(56:34) mind makes meaning that's why the damn a
(56:38) powder begins the mind is the chief
(56:40) thing people understand they understand
(56:47) and you see this in the Dhammapada
(56:49) there is no enemy greater than your own
(56:51) mind but there is no ally greater than
(56:53) your own mind people start understanding
(56:56) this double-edged sword of their own
(56:58) cognition undisciplined leads to
(57:03) violence through self-deception and
(57:06) illusion but discipline through self
(57:09) correction and self transcendence leads
(57:10) to wisdom and the ability to reduce the
(57:13) violence and the suffering so in our
(57:18) next meeting together we're going to
(57:20) talk more about this actual revolution
(57:22) and this sense that people had of their
(57:26) capacity for self transcendence and
(57:28) their capacity for self-deception
(57:30) and how that changed radically their
(57:32) sense of self and their sense of the
(57:34) world and how that changed
(57:36) what meaning meant and what wisdom meant
(57:40) thank you for your time
(57:42) [Music]
(58:00) you
