(00:00) [Music]
(00:14) welcome back to awakening from the
(00:17) meaning crisis so last time we discussed
(00:20) the important and foundational work of
(00:24) Plato the grammar of Western
(00:27) civilization is basically made up of the
(00:29) the Bible and Plato will keep coming
(00:32) back to both of those repeatedly in
(00:35) certain ways and we talked about Plato's
(00:39) notion of wisdom and how it involved
(00:42) this process of aligning the psyche so
(00:46) as to reduce inner conflict and reduce
(00:49) self-deception by bullshitting ourselves
(00:52) and that how that enabled us to also
(00:55) achieve one of our meta desires the
(00:58) desire for inner peace but how we could
(01:00) also align that reduction in
(01:02) self-deception with getting more in
(01:06) contact with what's real and that as we
(01:09) practice tracking real patterns in the
(01:12) world we could then reflectively
(01:14) internalize that back on ourselves and
(01:16) there was an intimate connection between
(01:18) how we knew the world and knew ourselves
(01:21) and as we increased our ability to pick
(01:24) up on real patterns we could increase
(01:26) our self-knowledge reduce our
(01:28) self-deception increase our contact with
(01:30) reality and that would flow in the
(01:32) process of an agog a and that would
(01:36) bring about the satisfaction of our
(01:37) second Metta desire which is to be in
(01:39) contact with realness and so Plato has
(01:41) this idea of wisdom as this an agogic
(01:44) process and we talked about that in
(01:47) connection with his great parable the
(01:50) parable of the cave I then pointed out
(01:53) that he had just as Socrates was lucky
(01:58) to have a great disciple in Plato Plato
(02:01) was lucky to have a great disciple in
(02:03) Aristotle and Aristotle is pivotal for
(02:06) us because he lays the foundation for a
(02:09) further aspects of a scientific approach
(02:14) to wisdom and meaning and also for an
(02:18) important formulation of one of the ways
(02:22) in which we deeply connect the self to
(02:24) reality that we're going
(02:25) talk about when we talk about worldview
(02:27) attunement so as I mentioned Aristotle
(02:29) was a student of Plato he studies with
(02:31) Plato for about twenty years and then at
(02:35) some point he breaks away from Plato
(02:37) famously claiming that while I love
(02:39) Plato I love the truth more Aristotle
(02:43) remained and many people would argue
(02:46) this gearson for example and others that
(02:48) Aristotle remains in some very important
(02:51) senses of plate Ness but there was an
(02:52) aspect of Plato's work that Aristotle
(02:55) thought was lacking Plato did not really
(03:01) adequately account for change so
(03:04) Aristotle was deeply influenced by
(03:06) Plato's account of what made for
(03:08) something real for us but he thought
(03:11) that Plato wasn't could not really
(03:13) explain change very well and he was
(03:15) going to invent some very important
(03:17) concepts that are going to become
(03:18) integral to understanding of what it is
(03:20) to be meaningfully connected to reality
(03:22) now Aristotle is very influenced by his
(03:26) father who is a physician he's much more
(03:29) of a biologist than a mathematician so
(03:31) all Plato is much more prone to using
(03:34) mathematical analogies aerosol is much
(03:37) more used to using biological analogies
(03:40) and the word that Aristotle uses for
(03:43) change is actually better translated as
(03:45) growth or development Aristotle was
(03:47) really interested in how living things
(03:48) grow how they develop and that should
(03:53) that should prick up your ears right
(03:54) away because part of I take it what we
(03:58) often mean when we say we have a
(03:59) meaningful life is that we are growing
(04:01) or developing in fact people will often
(04:04) use the word growth as a way of
(04:06) indicating an improvement in the meaning
(04:08) of their life and in some sense the
(04:11) developing of wisdom so Aristotle picks
(04:17) up on Plato's notion of the I das so if
(04:22) you remember last time we talked about
(04:23) this we talked about that a bird is much
(04:28) more than a set of its features it's not
(04:30) just a beak it's not just some feathers
(04:32) it's this Gestalt
(04:34) it's that structural functional
(04:36) organization such that all the parts
(04:38) function to get
(04:38) there was a hole and so what you have is
(04:41) something that acts as a bird and that
(04:44) pattern that logos that I toss is very
(04:48) hard actually to put into words but it's
(04:51) very much what does two things for us
(04:53) it's what makes a bird a bird and it's
(04:56) also the pattern by which we come to
(04:59) know what a bird is when we can grasp
(05:00) the structural functional organization
(05:03) that ID us then we understand what a
(05:06) bird is now Aristotle was very impressed
(05:09) by that but he wanted to give it a more
(05:12) dynamical approach he wanted to talk
(05:14) about it in terms of development and so
(05:17) he was very interested as I said in how
(05:20) things grow and he noted the role that
(05:26) form had in growth and development so he
(05:28) what he did was he first started what by
(05:30) an analogy so he would use the analogy
(05:34) of artifacts human-made things and then
(05:38) use that to try and understand
(05:40) biological things so for example I can
(05:44) have a block of wood right and I can
(05:48) make it into a chair or perhaps a table
(05:51) or if it's big enough amount of wood I
(05:53) can make it into a ship or a boat and
(05:57) Aristotle asked what makes the wood
(06:00) behave like a chair as opposed to a
(06:04) table or to a ship and this is where we
(06:08) get the notion of actuality from we
(06:11) often use the word actuality in fact as
(06:13) a way of talking about realness it's an
(06:15) actual something is a way of saying it's
(06:17) a real something as opposed to a fraud
(06:19) or simulation so what makes a chair act
(06:23) like a chair why does the wood act like
(06:27) a chair here act like a table here and
(06:29) act like a ship here and so Aristotle
(06:32) said well first of all this is important
(06:35) change and it's a good analogy for
(06:40) development when I'm making a chair
(06:43) that's somehow analogous for how an
(06:47) organism is growing
(06:50) so what is it that makes the would act
(06:54) like a chair here and act like a table
(06:56) here and his argument was well it's the
(06:59) forum again where this means i dot snot
(07:02) shape although you can use shape as an
(07:05) analogy this is the structural
(07:06) functional organization the wood is
(07:09) structurally functionally organized in
(07:11) such a way that it will act like a chair
(07:15) whereas here it will act like a table
(07:18) and here it will act like a ship now
(07:20) Aristotle's point is that this doesn't
(07:24) it's not that this doesn't play any role
(07:27) but he invents this really important
(07:30) idea he invents the idea that the wood
(07:32) is potential these terms actual and
(07:37) potential actually come from aerosol we
(07:39) use them every day we think they're just
(07:42) part of our natural grammar but they're
(07:44) actually an invention of Aristotle we're
(07:46) going to see how important they are so
(07:49) the idea is wood is potentially a chair
(07:51) what is potentially a table what is
(07:54) potentially a ship
(07:55) now when that potential has a particular
(07:58) form given to it then it starts acting
(08:00) like a chair it starts acting like a
(08:03) table and acting like a ship and this is
(08:05) where we get the notion of information
(08:06) from you put a form into something and
(08:10) you will actualize its potential namely
(08:13) you will give it a structural functional
(08:15) organization so it will start to act in
(08:17) a particular manner now that's really
(08:21) important and then what Aristotle argued
(08:25) is well what you see in living things is
(08:31) that they are basically doing this for
(08:33) themselves so if you'll use look I just
(08:37) mean this is an analogy a living thing
(08:38) is like a chair that is making itself a
(08:40) chair imagine that a chair could somehow
(08:43) start to impose a structural functional
(08:47) organization on wood so that it started
(08:50) to turn itself into a chair that's what
(08:53) a living thing does I mean you you food
(08:56) food is potential you you put food into
(08:59) you you inform it there is a code
(09:03) in your DNA that ultimately puts a
(09:05) particular form in it that gives it a
(09:08) structural functional organization that
(09:10) becomes you now of course this unfolds
(09:12) across time it's it's not it's not that
(09:15) doesn't happen like that and that's why
(09:17) we see it as change and development now
(09:21) this is really important as we'll see
(09:24) because it's going to be foundational to
(09:26) understanding a lot about how you
(09:29) connect to the world so how are we going
(09:36) to make use of this in talking about the
(09:40) way human beings are connected to
(09:43) reality the way they develop and grow as
(09:46) cognitive agents so what I want to do
(09:49) first is to step aside from Aristotle in
(09:51) the axial age and move into current
(09:54) cognitive science and talk about an
(09:57) important way of thinking about
(10:00) development and change especially the
(10:03) work of Alicia Arara that was directly
(10:05) and explicitly inspired by this
(10:08) Aristotelian framework so when we talk
(10:13) about how things change right we often
(10:17) have a model that we inherited from the
(10:21) Scientific Revolution a model we get
(10:23) from Newton and this is a model that
(10:26) change occurs because of causal impact
(10:29) so the standard thing it here's this
(10:31) marker right I press it why did it move
(10:36) it moved because I pushed it it seems so
(10:39) obvious and non-controversial right so
(10:43) we give an explanation what causes it to
(10:47) be because it was pushed it was and the
(10:51) idea of all change and development is
(10:55) there's an event a and it's some how
(10:58) right causes event B it causes event C
(11:02) event a precedes B makes B happen and
(11:06) then B precedes C and B makes C happen
(11:11) so as Newton was engaging in the
(11:15) Scientific Revolution this notion of how
(11:18) things happen was becoming prominent in
(11:20) him and for the people that was going to
(11:24) take up the Newtonian worldview and what
(11:25) was very interesting about that right is
(11:28) that this seemed to solve a lot of
(11:33) problems and this was brought out by a
(11:36) famous philosopher Immanuel Kant who the
(11:40) lessee Oro talks about Khan was
(11:42) interested in why was this Newtonian
(11:44) model becoming so successful the
(11:47) Aristotelian model had been around for
(11:48) thousands of years why was Newton's
(11:50) model overtaking it so rapidly and what
(11:54) Kant said is well this does something
(11:56) very wonderful for us because what it
(11:59) does is gives us a very simple account
(12:01) of how we explain things I explained C
(12:04) by showing you how it was preceded by an
(12:08) event B that caused it and he'll be was
(12:10) preceded by an event a that caused it
(12:14) very nice linear clean and we like it
(12:17) seems it really isn't that what's
(12:18) happening so obvious all right and again
(12:22) remember again and again I've tried to
(12:24) show you things that seem so obvious so
(12:26) natural are actually historical
(12:28) creations you have to pay attention to
(12:31) how we got where we are now why does
(12:34) this matter well because this prevents a
(12:37) kind of vacuous explanation that can
(12:42) occur this prevents what are called
(12:44) circular explanations this line right
(12:48) prevents circular explanations
(12:55) okay so circular explanation is when you
(12:59) assume the very thing you're trying to
(13:02) explain in your explanation so here's a
(13:05) standard kind of model people often use
(13:07) this without realizing you know there's
(13:09) a triangle out here in the world the
(13:11) light comes in into my eye that goes
(13:14) through new earth pulses that goes into
(13:16) my consciousness right it's somehow
(13:18) projected onto an inner screen and then
(13:20) there's a triangle there and then
(13:21) there's a little man inside and he goes
(13:24) triangle right and we have updated
(13:28) versions of this like the Central
(13:30) Executive and such right this is called
(13:32) a homunculus eerie homunculus means a
(13:34) little man now when you present it like
(13:37) that I hope you can all see why this is
(13:39) obviously useless because what you
(13:41) should then ask is well how does the
(13:42) little man see the little triangle
(13:44) inside and then what you go is well
(13:46) inside the little man's head there's an
(13:48) even smaller screen with a littler man
(13:50) going triangle but how does he see you
(13:54) you see what this is it's an infinite
(13:56) regress because you're actually using
(13:58) vision to try and explain vision now
(14:01) please remember this notion of a
(14:02) homunculus II cuz that's what this is
(14:04) because well it's easy to explain I need
(14:07) you to understand that we fall into it
(14:09) very often when we try and understand
(14:11) and explain ourselves okay
(14:15) that is a circular explanation because
(14:18) you're using the very thing you're
(14:19) trying to explain in order to explain it
(14:21) Kant said this Newtonian scheme is
(14:24) wonderful because if you stick to its
(14:26) grammar of you sticks to its rules the
(14:28) cars has to be an independent event that
(14:30) proceeds right then you don't fall into
(14:35) circular explanations that's amazing
(14:39) now you've got some problems here what
(14:41) started it all right right and you know
(14:46) maybe God and then Khan says no and he's
(14:49) got all his arguments when I'm not going
(14:50) to get into that right now suffice it to
(14:52) say that this became a predominant way
(14:55) of trying to explain how things work but
(14:57) then Kant encountered a very significant
(15:00) problem and it's it's and it's not a
(15:03) coincidence and it has to do with the
(15:06) kinds of things we were talking about
(15:08) with Aristotle
(15:08) the kinds of things that can grow living
(15:12) things because Conn went out and he saw
(15:14) a tree right and this was very
(15:18) problematic for him because trees don't
(15:20) follow this model readily because he was
(15:24) looking at it was saying okay well
(15:25) what's making the tree well it's the
(15:29) sunlight well how does the Sun like get
(15:31) in through the leaves so right what's
(15:34) making the leaves well the tree so the
(15:36) tree makes the leaves and the leaves
(15:37) make the tree so the tree is making the
(15:40) tree and he coined the term
(15:44) self-organizing the tree is
(15:50) self-organizing now the problem with
(15:53) that is right living things make use of
(15:56) feedback cycles in a feedback cycle the
(16:04) output from the system feeds back into
(16:06) the system the tree makes the leaves
(16:09) that gathers energy that goes into the
(16:11) processes that makes the leaves living
(16:15) things are self-organizing they use
(16:17) feedback cycles but when I try and give
(16:20) an explanation of a feedback cycle I
(16:24) fall into a circular explanation I fall
(16:28) into a circular explanation and so Kourt
(16:34) came to a rather startling conclusion he
(16:37) came to the conclusion that there could
(16:38) not be a science of living things the
(16:40) biology was impossible now Cantus one is
(16:46) a towering intellect is like he's a gene
(16:48) is a philosophical genius and so you
(16:51) can't just sort of dismiss that K well
(16:52) there obviously is biology what an idiot
(16:54) conscious no no you're the one who needs
(16:57) to step back and think where's the
(16:59) mistake in the argument because if there
(17:03) is biology and it's true that there is
(17:06) and I agree that there is right and that
(17:09) living things use feedback cycles which
(17:12) they necessarily do they're
(17:14) self-organizing which they necessarily
(17:16) are and when I try and trace out the
(17:19) causation I get into circular
(17:21) explanation
(17:22) which seems like a necessary thing and
(17:24) circular explanations are vacuous and
(17:27) empty then where's caught going wrong
(17:32) this is what your yer ro takes up and
(17:36) she said actually for a very long time
(17:38) we had no way of solving this problem
(17:40) and so there was a huge gap between our
(17:44) biology and our physics now again why
(17:47) are we caring about this because we need
(17:51) to if we're going to understand
(17:53) Aristotle
(17:54) if we're gonna deeply understand what we
(17:56) mean when we talk about that we are
(17:59) living things that grow and develop and
(18:02) that growth and development is integral
(18:04) to our meaning and our sense of who and
(18:06) what we are our personal identity that
(18:09) if we cannot give an answer to this
(18:12) problem we cannot understand
(18:16) fundamentally who and what we are and
(18:19) what the hell we are talking about when
(18:22) we talk about how important growth and
(18:24) development are to us because that
(18:27) language will forever be separate from
(18:29) any kind of scientific understanding so
(18:34) where's this going wrong this seems just
(18:40) like living things our feedback cycles
(18:44) self-organizing they grow they develop
(18:46) they they make themselves right so what
(18:51) what has to go well this now before you
(18:56) jump with it but that's just that's just
(18:58) what causation is think about the fact
(18:59) that we know we actually know that
(19:02) Newton's ultimately wrong right
(19:06) Newton doesn't work with relativity
(19:09) Newton doesn't work at the quantum level
(19:12) so we know that we shouldn't be
(19:14) absolutely committed to this view now
(19:18) your ro actually makes use of an
(19:21) important idea from Aristotle to solve
(19:24) this problem so
(19:30) she's going to use Aristotle in order to
(19:33) explain in a new and powerful way of
(19:38) talking about growth and development and
(19:41) self-organizing processes which is known
(19:43) as dynamical Systems Theory so aro first
(19:48) of all makes a distinction between
(19:51) causes and constraints so to get at that
(19:57) distinction let's go back to what seems
(19:59) so obvious okay here's the marker I push
(20:05) it why did it move
(20:07) and immediately the Newtonian grammar
(20:09) just comes into place it moved because
(20:11) you pushed it and then you might step
(20:12) out outside of physics and say well I
(20:15) wanted to push it and the Dodson that's
(20:17) not what I'm asking because it right it
(20:20) could also just be that some other
(20:21) object bumped into this and it moved why
(20:24) else did it move okay so think about
(20:30) what has to also be true in order for
(20:33) this to move there has to be empty space
(20:37) relatively empty space in front of the
(20:39) marker this has to have a particular
(20:41) shape to it
(20:42) this has to have a particular shape to
(20:46) it
(20:47) those aren't events right those are
(20:51) conditions causes are events that make
(20:54) things happen
(21:00) constraints right aren't events they're
(21:04) conditions they don't make things happen
(21:07) they make things possible and there's a
(21:14) big difference between a condition and
(21:15) an event the Newtonian way of thinking
(21:19) has us so fixated on this so
(21:22) foregrounded on this that we're not
(21:26) seeing this anymore BC Aristotle because
(21:31) of his platonic view actually considers
(21:34) this more important why because when I
(21:37) talk about a structural functional
(21:40) organization when I talk about a pattern
(21:42) I'm talking about this this is where you
(21:46) will find form this is where sometimes
(21:50) called the formal cause this is where
(21:55) you'll find the structural functional
(21:56) organization
(22:05) right conditions are structurally
(22:07) functionally organized such that motion
(22:10) for this is possible now this is
(22:16) important because this is of course
(22:19) actuality and this is where we get
(22:22) potentiality when I shape possibility
(22:27) that's what I mean when I say something
(22:29) is potential I mean that possibility has
(22:32) been shaped by constraints so that these
(22:37) events are more possible than these
(22:39) events okay so we're going to do more
(22:42) but let's stop here and let's see how
(22:44) this is already starting to solve the
(22:47) problem of talking about the tree and
(22:48) it's self-organization so in a tree
(22:52) you've got a bunch of events happening
(22:55) biochemical events what they're doing is
(23:00) they're actually causing a particular
(23:02) right form or formula or structural
(23:07) functional organization now think about
(23:10) it why do trees grow the way they do why
(23:12) do they grow like this why do they
(23:15) spread out their branches why do their
(23:17) leaves spread out because what they're
(23:19) trying to do is they're trying to change
(23:22) the possibility of a photon hitting a
(23:25) chlorophyll molecule the structure of
(23:28) the tree shapes the possibility of the
(23:33) events so the events right cause this
(23:36) structure and then right they cause it
(23:39) but this then constrains the events so
(23:46) look at me I'm a living thing I've got a
(23:48) bunch of events happening in me and that
(23:52) creates a structural functional
(23:53) organization that organization creates
(23:56) an internal environment in which the
(23:58) probability of events is dramatically
(24:01) altered so events that have very low
(24:03) probability happening out there have a
(24:04) high probability of happening in here
(24:06) and events that have a very high
(24:08) probability of happening out there have
(24:10) a very low probability of happening in
(24:12) here and that's what it is to be a
(24:13) living thing the events right cause a
(24:17) structure
(24:18) a structural functional organization and
(24:20) I das a form and then that constrains
(24:23) the events now this is not a circular
(24:28) explanation because I'm talking about
(24:30) two very different kinds of things I'm
(24:33) talking about actuality and potentiality
(24:37) now it's important to realize that the
(24:42) discussion of possibility many of you
(24:44) were saying oh this is like ah so
(24:45) abstract and what does this this is
(24:48) actually integral to science okay
(24:51) science depends on there being real
(24:54) potential the potentiality is a real
(24:56) thing all right so you know here's the
(25:01) object moving around all right
(25:03) it's on the ground look at all this
(25:05) kinetic energy look at it moving look at
(25:07) oh it stopped did I destroy all that
(25:10) energy where did the kinetic energy go
(25:13) you can't destroy energy
(25:15) well the kinetic energy has become
(25:16) potential energy if the principle of the
(25:20) conservation of mass and energy is real
(25:22) then potentiality is real look at this
(25:25) look at look at something from Newton
(25:27) force equals mass times acceleration is
(25:30) that an event is that oh that's
(25:33) happening over there right now was it is
(25:35) it that does it happen every Tuesday at
(25:37) 4 o'clock this isn't an event this is
(25:42) right how things are shaped it puts a
(25:45) limit on what's possible in the world
(25:49) talking about real potentiality is not
(25:54) talking fictional or abstract it's a
(25:56) it's a way of talking that's integral to
(25:58) our current science ok
(26:05) we're still not done though because your
(26:09) ro points out that there are two kinds
(26:11) of constraints so our explanations can
(26:13) become even more refined there are
(26:15) constraints that make a form of event a
(26:20) type of event more possible she calls
(26:23) those enabling constraints right and
(26:30) then there are constraints that reduce
(26:33) the possibilities reduce the options for
(26:35) a system these are the selected or
(26:37) selective constraints
(26:47) now this is going to give us a very
(26:49) powerful way of understanding
(26:52) development let's use it the way yarrow
(26:57) does to talk about one of the most
(27:00) significant theories of development and
(27:03) change one of the great hallmarks of
(27:06) science in fact it's a foundational
(27:09) theory for the science of biology which
(27:11) of course is the theory of natural
(27:13) selection its theory of Darwinian
(27:15) evolution because the theory of
(27:17) Darwinian evolution is probably the
(27:19) first dynamical Systems theory in
(27:21) science and it is a theory that is
(27:25) designed precisely to account for growth
(27:27) and development obviously they are not
(27:30) within an individual but across
(27:32) speciation ok so let's take a look at
(27:35) the theory so what you're looking for
(27:38) first of all there has to be a feedback
(27:39) cycle for right any dynamical system
(27:44) theory because we're talking about a
(27:45) process that's self-organizing so what's
(27:49) the feedback cycle that evolution talks
(27:50) about of course well it's sexual
(27:52) reproduction where the dotes come from
(27:55) other goats goats are produced there's
(28:00) the product and then it feeds back into
(28:02) the system and becomes the producer
(28:04) makes more goats that make more goats
(28:06) that makes more goats that's why we call
(28:08) it reproduction it's a feedback cycle so
(28:12) what did Darwin realize well he realized
(28:14) that there were selective constraints
(28:18) operating on that there were conditions
(28:19) in the environment that reduced the
(28:23) options for organism that's right so
(28:28) what's those conditions scarcity of
(28:30) resources okay
(28:32) so I've been looking at some of the
(28:37) theories of early life and there's an
(28:39) argument by several biologists that
(28:41) there's no evolution for about probably
(28:42) eight hundred thousand years or so
(28:44) because there's no scarcity of resources
(28:47) with my first of all so life is static
(28:49) because there's no scarcity of resources
(28:52) scarcity of resources means there's
(28:54) competition scarcity of resources means
(28:58) not everything can live
(29:00) and so that reduces the options for the
(29:03) system
(29:05) okay so selection reducing options but
(29:14) that's not all that's going on right if
(29:16) that was the case everything would die
(29:17) evolution would end I mean you know and
(29:20) that can happen extinction events but
(29:22) there's something else there's enabling
(29:25) constraints that open up the system open
(29:29) up the options so look around look at me
(29:38) look at other people there's variation
(29:42) there's considerable variation variation
(29:47) increases the options
(29:59) so look what's going on here you've got
(30:03) this feedback cycle as its as it's
(30:05) cycling through you've got the selective
(30:08) conditions reducing the options that are
(30:11) available and then the variation opening
(30:14) in them up you can think of it almost
(30:15) like an accordion model the variation
(30:17) opens it up and then as it cycles the
(30:21) selective constraint pushes it down and
(30:23) then from there it opens up again and
(30:26) then it gets pushed back down and then
(30:29) it opens up again and gets pushed back
(30:30) down and as it cycles like this it's
(30:33) constantly changing in a way to be
(30:37) better fitted to the environment that's
(30:39) evolution right it's a kind of circular
(30:42) evolve is related to words like revolve
(30:44) it's this revolution with change now
(30:50) notice what I'm trying to get you to see
(30:52) is like first of all this is important I
(30:54) mean I wish I was Charles Darwin this is
(30:56) one of the great great theories he gets
(30:58) to sail around the world and what a life
(31:00) he gets to sail around the world go to
(31:03) some amazing places and then he comes
(31:05) back and makes a world-changing theory
(31:07) it's amazing but notice how much this
(31:11) Darwinian theory that is at the
(31:13) foundation of biology how much it is
(31:18) beholden to Aristotle how much it
(31:22) depends on Aristotelian ideas okay now
(31:27) your ro
(31:28) talks about this as a virtual governor
(31:33) so a governor is right there's any
(31:37) device that sort of limits what you can
(31:40) do on a system like if you have a
(31:42) governor on a steam-engine right
(31:45) it sets the range it limits the range at
(31:48) which you can cycle she calls it a
(31:50) virtual governor because it's not an
(31:52) actual machine it's the shaping of
(31:54) possibility she stops there and work
(31:57) that I've done with Leah Ferraro and
(31:59) Anderson Todd and Richard we think we
(32:01) should you should continue to finish the
(32:03) metaphor this is a virtual generator
(32:08) because it's a set of conditions that
(32:10) are generating off
(32:12) for a self-organizing system and here's
(32:16) the idea when you put a virtual governor
(32:23) systematically together with a virtual
(32:25) generator such that you are
(32:30) systematically regulating a feedback
(32:33) cycle this whole thing is a virtual
(32:40) engine because when you attach a
(32:44) governor to a generator you get a
(32:47) virtual engine so this is what a
(32:48) dynamical system theory is a dynamical
(32:50) system theory is basically a theory that
(32:53) lays out the virtual engine it shows you
(32:56) how there's a feedback cycle and why
(32:59) that's not just random and chaotic why
(33:02) it produces growth and development
(33:04) precisely because there's a systematic
(33:06) relationship between a set of enabling
(33:09) and selective constraints now all of
(33:14) this is very very Aristotelian so let's
(33:17) now take it back to Aristotle because
(33:21) Aristotle was interested now he he
(33:23) doesn't use this he doesn't use the
(33:26) dynamical systems language that's our
(33:27) language but this language too was
(33:30) directly inspired by powered by
(33:33) Aristotle so using it backwards to try
(33:36) and connect Aristotle to a current
(33:39) understanding I do not think is
(33:40) anachronistic so Aristotle is interested
(33:46) in our development he's going to add
(33:49) something that was missing from the
(33:51) Socratic notion of wisdom
(33:52) remember the Socratic notion was trying
(33:54) to overcome self-deception and then
(33:57) Plato
(33:57) adds a whole structural theory of the
(34:00) psyche to explain how we overcome
(34:02) self-deception how we become wise and
(34:04) achieve wisdom but what's missing in the
(34:07) account of wisdom and meaning according
(34:11) to Aristotle if I can use this language
(34:12) as what's missing is an account of
(34:15) growth and development
(34:16) how does wisdom develop how does meaning
(34:18) develop well this is where we get
(34:23) something
(34:25) that we talk about and we use as in our
(34:29) language but we don't I think get the
(34:36) depth of what Aristotle is talking about
(34:39) there's an aspect of who and what you
(34:41) are that's fundamentally connected to
(34:44) your projects of meaning and your
(34:46) project of wisdom you often it might
(34:49) have used this term or related terms but
(34:52) do you really know what you're talking
(34:53) about and this is the notion of your
(34:55) character now first of all your
(35:02) character isn't your personality because
(35:04) if we're going to use these terms
(35:05) strictly you're born with your
(35:06) personality personality is part of your
(35:09) just your general Constitution it's
(35:12) what's given to you by the biology and
(35:14) the environment that you have no choice
(35:16) over right but your character is that
(35:20) aspect of you that you can cultivate now
(35:23) you can either cultivate it
(35:24) unconsciously surreptitiously indirectly
(35:29) or you can cultivate it more explicitly
(35:35) but what is your character when we say
(35:38) that somebody's acting out of character
(35:40) we're usually making and this is
(35:42) important we're usually making either an
(35:44) existential or moral criticism of them
(35:46) when we say Peter is acting out of
(35:48) character we often will mean something
(35:51) like he's normally honest he's normally
(35:54) honest he normally has the virtue of
(35:56) honest notice the connection here by the
(35:58) way virtue and we've been talking about
(36:02) a virtual engine that is not
(36:04) happenstance when you're talking about a
(36:08) virtue you're not talking about an event
(36:09) you're talking about again a set of
(36:12) conditions that have been cultivated
(36:14) systematically in somebody now that
(36:17) points to something that we're talking
(36:18) about character I'm gonna suggest that
(36:20) what we're talking about is what is the
(36:23) virtual engine on a person's development
(36:29) what system of constraints have you
(36:32) identified with and what system of
(36:37) constraints have you internalized that
(36:40) regulate the development that's let's
(36:44) ask a Socratic question let's do
(36:47) something that Socrates would do we
(36:51) spend a lot of time on our appearance we
(36:53) spend a lot of time on our status how
(36:57) much time did you spend today on your
(37:01) character how much
(37:11) if it is the virtual engine that is
(37:14) regulating your growth and development
(37:16) you should be of course spending a lot
(37:18) of time on your character but are you
(37:27) now Aristotle proposed ways of trying to
(37:31) cultivate your character I I would argue
(37:35) that his method his famous method of the
(37:37) golden mean is a way of trying to get
(37:39) you to set up conditions to cultivate
(37:42) your character so for example what is
(37:44) courage we would all like to be more
(37:47) courageous they take it
(37:49) well Aristotle proposed that it falls
(37:52) it's the golden mean not the average
(37:54) that's a misunderstanding right because
(37:57) it's golden mean between two things of
(38:00) course you can be a coward you can
(38:05) somehow be defective by having a
(38:09) deficiency but you can also be foolhardy
(38:14) right just running into traffic doesn't
(38:17) make you courageous what you're always
(38:20) trying to do is you're trying to set up
(38:25) a system where you're paying attention
(38:27) when you lack the enabling constraints
(38:30) where you don't have enough generation
(38:31) and also conditions when you lack the
(38:35) selective constraints when you have your
(38:37) right you too broadly you have too many
(38:41) options that you're identifying as
(38:44) courage what you have to do is you have
(38:45) to train yourself if the cultivate your
(38:48) character by engaging in practices that
(38:52) will slowly over time create a virtual
(38:57) engine because you are look you are a
(39:00) self-organizing process you are the
(39:03) source of your actions that modify the
(39:07) environment that then feeds back into
(39:09) you and changes you and then you produce
(39:13) your actions and then the environment
(39:15) feeds back and changes you here's the
(39:17) question I ask you are you just letting
(39:18) that run
(39:23) or are you trying to rationally and
(39:26) reflectively cultivate your character
(39:29) structure a virtual engine so that that
(39:32) self-organizing process is growing and
(39:35) developing in an optimal fashion
(39:39) Aristotle takes the question and we use
(39:42) this we even use and we are not saying
(39:44) we use it trivially but we don't get the
(39:47) depth of what we saying what we're
(39:48) saying
(39:49) one of the most trenchant criticisms we
(39:51) can make of ourselves of other people is
(39:53) this listen listen to my language listen
(39:57) to it he's not living up living up to
(40:02) his potential part of what makes your
(40:10) life meaningful is that you have
(40:12) cultivated character that allows you to
(40:16) actualize your potential you've created
(40:20) a virtual engine that regulates your
(40:22) development in a way in which you grow
(40:25) up it's a constantly improves proof it's
(40:28) a confidence in which self-organization
(40:31) has been regulated and shaped into
(40:35) self-improvement so that your potential
(40:38) is fully realized so Aristotle brings in
(40:45) this notion then of development and
(40:49) growth as part of what it means to have
(40:53) a meaningful life he brings in a new
(40:56) aspect to the notion of wisdom wisdom is
(41:00) gaining the ability to cultivate virtues
(41:03) to create your virtual engine a set of
(41:06) right virtues that basically is
(41:11) regulating your growth and development
(41:14) so that you actualize your potential
(41:20) again
(41:22) think about it what are you doing to
(41:29) cultivate your character because
(41:31) Aristotle points out there's a deep form
(41:33) of foolishness that comes from a lack of
(41:36) character calls it a crazy which we
(41:44) poorly translate as weakness of the will
(41:46) because we're all post Protestants and
(41:48) we think the will is our central thing
(41:49) even though increasingly there's
(41:51) scientific evidence that the notion of
(41:53) will or will power is a defunct idea we
(41:55) should give it up right so what's a
(42:00) crazy
(42:00) the creature is when you know what the
(42:01) right thing to do is you know what the
(42:03) right thing to do is and we talked about
(42:05) this remember with the chocolate cake
(42:06) but you don't do the right thing and
(42:09) here's where we can sort of put
(42:12) Aristotle and Plato together Plato gives
(42:15) us the sort of story about how we have
(42:17) to structure the psyche but Aristotle
(42:22) gives us a much more penetrating
(42:24) analysis of what that structural
(42:26) functional organization is here's what
(42:28) era thought it would say why you're
(42:30) behaving foolishly ignorance is when you
(42:33) do the wrong thing because you don't
(42:34) know part of what foolishness is is when
(42:37) you know what the right thing is and you
(42:38) still do the wrong thing here's
(42:41) Aristotle's answer you do the wrong
(42:43) thing because although you have the
(42:44) right beliefs and notice the again the
(42:47) impotence of belief here you don't have
(42:50) the right you don't have sufficient
(42:52) character you have not trained things
(42:58) you've not trained skills you've not
(43:00) trained sensitivities you have not
(43:02) created a virtual engine that is
(43:05) regulating your development and growth
(43:09) such that you will live up to your
(43:15) potential
(43:16) you will actualize yourself and do the
(43:19) right thing so we're starting to see
(43:25) again the deep grammar of what we talk
(43:29) about when we talk about meaning
(43:35) and we notice now that there's this
(43:38) developmental aspect to it what is it to
(43:43) live up to your potential
(43:46) I mean that's a phrase we use what is it
(43:49) you're saying when you say that about
(43:51) somebody why does it matter so much so
(44:00) Aristotle would say let's go back to the
(44:04) analogy please always remember that
(44:06) Cinelli let's go back to the analogy of
(44:08) a man-made thing okay how is it when we
(44:14) know when something has been well made
(44:17) what makes it something a good knife
(44:21) right well when it has a structural
(44:29) functional organization right that
(44:39) allows it to fulfill its purpose no
(44:42) knives are for cutting if I've taken the
(44:46) potential in the metal and organized at
(44:48) the right way structure to the right way
(44:50) it will actually function to cut very
(44:51) well right I noticed that this is a word
(44:57) that's also deeply associated with our
(45:01) sense of what it is to have meaning so
(45:08) Aristotle asks well what can we do with
(45:10) this analogy human beings aren't made
(45:12) the way knives are made we're self
(45:15) making and here's here's an important
(45:18) idea we're self making we're not just
(45:23) self organizing the term that's
(45:26) Francisco Varela and Evan Thompson have
(45:28) generated to talk about this is we are
(45:30) autopoietic we are self making things so
(45:33) you're different from a tornado a
(45:34) tornado is self organizing but a tornado
(45:37) will move its behavior can be rapidly
(45:41) self-destructive it will move into
(45:43) conditions that destroy it your self
(45:45) organized in such a way
(45:47) that you have a structural functional
(45:49) organization that allows you to seek out
(45:51) conditions so the tornado does not seek
(45:55) out the conditions that will protect and
(45:57) promote its own self organization it's
(45:59) not self making you are self making so
(46:02) here's the interesting thing in and this
(46:05) is a brilliant idea that Eric pearl
(46:06) brings out in his book thinking being
(46:08) right in living things right the purpose
(46:11) of the thing is its structural
(46:13) functional organization it's a it's a
(46:15) self making thing so what your what your
(46:20) purpose your function is is to enhance
(46:23) your structural functional organization
(46:27) it's like oh well let's this is a
(46:30) problem you'll say with philosophy
(46:31) there's also abstract what does that
(46:33) mean specifically well for Aristotle it
(46:36) means paying attention to the fact that
(46:39) you are a rational reflective creature
(46:49) you're unlike a plant a plant has this
(46:54) but all it basically does is actualize
(46:57) its ability to sort of digest so let's
(47:03) take a look at this we have in organic
(47:05) matter right and then it gets a
(47:11) particular it's informed and that makes
(47:15) like a living thing and that living
(47:21) things can get a more complex structure
(47:24) that make them self moving that's what
(47:29) an animal is an animal isn't a mammal an
(47:32) animal is a self moving thing and then
(47:36) some of those self moving things have
(47:39) structural functional organizations
(47:40) here's in here for example that take
(47:43) that self moving and really actualize it
(47:47) remember we talked about that the word
(47:48) psyche where we get our word psychology
(47:50) mind originally meant your capacity for
(47:52) self moving and we claim to apply to the
(47:55) mind because the mind is that part of
(47:56) you that is the cell most self moving
(47:58) the most self making
(48:11) your mental thing a psychological thing
(48:17) but is that enough no we're getting from
(48:23) Socrates and Plato and Aristotle you can
(48:28) optimize that you can take charge of
(48:31) that you unlike other organisms you can
(48:36) do the actual revolution on yourself
(48:38) you're capable of cultivating your own
(48:41) character rationally and deliberately
(48:44) you can become right a rational thing to
(48:58) live up to your potential is to make
(49:04) sure you have cultivated a character
(49:06) that takes you as high up this hierarchy
(49:09) as you can go that's how you live up to
(49:12) your potential somebody who lived only
(49:15) as a plant would be a debauched failed
(49:21) degraded human being somebody that lived
(49:25) only as an animal unreflective Lee
(49:30) impulsively would be a debauched failed
(49:33) human being but the argument continues
(49:37) you say of course of course but all the
(49:43) way up here
(49:47) you must cultivate your character so
(49:50) that you as much as possible actualize
(49:54) your potential for being a rational
(49:58) moral human being that's the hallmark of
(50:04) for Aristotle you become a good person
(50:11) if you actualize if you inform your
(50:16) being with a virtual engine that really
(50:20) realizes those things that are
(50:22) distinctive of our humanity what makes
(50:28) us different from the plants the animals
(50:31) the other creatures that just have Minds
(50:34) what makes us different we understand
(50:39) that we have always and we still do
(50:42) understand
(50:43) understand ourselves in contrast to the
(50:46) other things we find around ourselves
(50:47) how are why am I more valuable than this
(50:51) table what is it why do i matter more
(51:02) because there are things that can be
(51:05) found in rational beings things that we
(51:08) find intrinsically valuable and
(51:10) important that cannot be finding in
(51:12) merely mental things and all the way
(51:14) down what are those characteristics that
(51:19) are unique to us well here's where
(51:21) Aristotle gives the actual revolution
(51:23) answer your capacity for overcoming
(51:30) self-deception your capacity for
(51:33) cultivating your character for realizing
(51:37) wisdom and for enhancing the structure
(51:41) of your psyche and your contact with
(51:43) reality
(51:44) that's what rational means this sounds
(51:49) if I hadn't said all this what I'm going
(51:52) to say now it sound trite your purpose
(51:54) is to become as fully human as possible
(52:04) how are you cultivating your character
(52:08) to do so this is what era stalls going
(52:10) to ask you again and again how much of
(52:14) your life is dedicated to creating a
(52:16) virtual engine that realizes your
(52:19) rational capacities those things that
(52:22) make you most human in contrast to all
(52:26) the other things around you so Aristotle
(52:37) has developed this very impressive
(52:40) theory of wisdom character growth and
(52:47) development one of the things we could
(52:50) use today is to go back and make use of
(52:53) this so we can reanimate rejuvenate
(52:57) these terms that have become tired and
(53:00) superficial we have no alternative terms
(53:02) to for describing our lives for the
(53:05) meaning in our life we talk about
(53:06) purpose and living up to our potential
(53:08) and growth and development and which
(53:10) blahblah because we don't have any depth
(53:13) to these terms one of the things we can
(53:17) use Aristotle to do is to go back and
(53:22) deepen what those terms mean for us
(53:25) rejuvenate what they mean for us but I
(53:32) want to continue on and to talk about
(53:36) this development that was occurring in
(53:40) the actual revolution and I want to talk
(53:42) about how Aristotle helped further the
(53:46) historical process by which he
(53:49) contributed to our cultural grammar of
(53:51) what it is when we're talking about
(53:54) meaning purpose wisdom self
(53:58) transcendence and so what I want to look
(53:59) at next time when we're together is I
(54:01) want to look at Aristotle's account of a
(54:04) worldview and what a worldview is and
(54:09) why it matters so deeply to our self
(54:12) understanding and our existential
(54:14) meaning thank you very much for your
(54:15) time
(54:16) [Music]
(54:20) you
(54:21) [Music]
(54:34) you
(54:36) you
